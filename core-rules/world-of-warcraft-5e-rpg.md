*“The sands of time have run out”*<br>
*- Medivh, the last Guardian*

Many have waited for Blizzard to approve another conversion of their world to the tabletop playing
realm. Alas, many waited in vain.
 
*“We will persevere.”*<br>
*- The Blood Elves*

However, tabletop players are well-known for their persistence and tenacity in getting what they
want to play - or at least, satisfying themselves with an adequate enough replica.
 
*“Sometimes, the hand of Fate must be forced.”*<br>
*- Illidan Stormrage*

And thus, the World of Warcraft 5e RPG Conversion begun.

This conversion is of the much-loved World of Warcraft Role universe, as for 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons, made by the fans, for the fans.

This not only includes special classes, races, and magical spells, but also includes magical items, and even a few subsystems (such as infusion, mana, and crafting) built in the streamlined format of 5th edition, for the benefit of all roleplayers.

## Determining Ability Scores

</div>


#### Focus and Foible. 

This method leads to more focused characters with clearer weaknesses.

Before applying modifiers, choose one focus (an ability score you‘re good at) and one foible (an ability score you‘re bad at).<br><br>

*Focus*. Mark this attribute as 18

*Foible*. Mark this attribute as 8
<br><br>
Set your remaining attributes at 10, and distribute 16 points among the ability scores in any way you desire. You may reduce an existing attribute by up to 2 points to gain 2 points to add to another attribute.

\columnbreak

#### Heroic Roll

This method leads to generally stronger characters than by normal rolling.

For each ability score, roll 2d6 + 6.

## Beyond 1st Level

The rules in the World of Warcraft 5e RPG also include crafting sub-systems and classes (such as the Alchemist and Tinker), and
various options (such as the Infusionist feat) that can translate wealth into character power.

When creating a character from above 1st level, refer to the following guidelines for expected wealth for level to give a general
idea how to keep characters on the same general level of wealth.

Refer to the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table on Chapter 7 to calculate item rarity. Note that crafting an item costs one half the cost of buying it.

| Level  | Typical Wealth |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | 0 (or background starting wealth) |
|  2  | 140 gp |
|  3  | 280 gp |
|  4  | 420 gp |
|  5  | 560 gp |
|  6  | 4,500 gp |
|  7  | 8,400 gp |
|  8  | 12,300 gp |
|  9  | 16,200 gp |
|  10  | 20,100 gp |
|  11  | 24,100 gp |
|  12  | 42,400 gp |
|  13  | 60,700 gp |
|  14  | 79,000 gp |
|  15  | 97,300 gp |
|  16  | 116,000 gp |
|  17  | 134,000 gp |
|  18  | 362,000 gp |
|  19  | 590,000 gp |
|  20  | 818,000 gp |

The amount of wealth carried by a character can vary significantly depending on starting resources, unexpected loot gained in the
campaign, whether or not characters have downtime to gather additional wealth, inherited gold, or even possessing companies
and strongholds under their control.

\columnbreak

##### Magical Item Budget

A DM may refer to the above chart to determine the total worth of magic items the characters have, without actually explicit magic items to be sold.

In this case, the wealth is not the expected wealth of the character, but the cost of the magic items the player should have by the
appropriate level. This can come in the form of quest gifts, a normal item improving into a magical one, or a permanent blessing or
infusion upon a held item.

The expected cost of magic items relative to rarity is present in Chapter 7.

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

##### Expected Downtime

In case of crafting classes (Alchemist and Tinker), or in cases where characters can create magical items (taking the Infusionist
feat), a good amount of downtime to allow the classes to function at a competitive rate is usually 5 days to 1 week between adventures (or the same time for every 3-5 combat encounters).

That way, very complex projects (2 weeks) like building a mecha or vehicle can be done every two adventures.

With such options available, players benefit more from wealth and time to build the exact items they need, from scrolls, potions,
explosives, and more spells in a mage's spellbook, to advanced constructs and vehicles such as gyrocopters, so exercising
judgment is key.

## Races

<div class="wide">

The races of Warcraft are diverse and rich. Each race has a role in the world, and their deeds resonate through the ages. Members of each race view each other with assumptions formed by past conflicts and alliances. Warcraft‘s history is troubled and epic, and every aspect influences the races, their beliefs and their roles.

The races described here are not the only races in the Warcraft world, but they are the most dominant, influential, and prone to adventuring. Other races can be found in the Monster Guide.
