*“The sands of time have run out”*<br>
*- Medivh, the last Guardian*

Many have waited for Blizzard to approve another conversion of their world to the tabletop playing
realm. Alas, many waited in vain.
 
*“We will persevere.”*<br>
*- The Blood Elves*

However, tabletop players are well-known for their persistence and tenacity in getting what they
want to play - or at least, satisfying themselves with an adequate enough replica.
 
*“Sometimes, the hand of Fate must be forced.”*<br>
*- Illidan Stormrage*

And thus, the World of Warcraft 5e RPG Conversion begun.

This conversion is of the much-loved World of Warcraft Role universe, as for 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons, made by the fans, for the fans.

This not only includes special classes, races, and magical spells, but also includes magical items, and even a few subsystems (such as infusion, mana, and crafting) built in the streamlined format of 5th edition, for the benefit of all roleplayers.

# Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters

<div class="wide">
When determining your ability scores (also known as attributes), there are two new methods to
create them; the focused method, and the heroic method. Both yield higher attributes on average,
suitable for the many challenges in the Warcraft universe.
</div>

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

<div class="wide">

## Ability Score Summary

</div>

#### Strength
___
- **Measures:** Natural athleticism, bodily power
- **Important for:** Death Knight, Paladin, and Warrior
- **Racial Increases:** Bronzebeard Dwarf (+1), Draenei (+2), Forsaken (+1), Orc (+2), Human (+1), Tauren (+2), Troll (+1, +2 if Drakkari), Worgen (+1)

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>
 
#### Agility

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

## Determining Ability Scores

#### Focus and Foible. 

This method leads to more focused characters with clearer weaknesses.

Before applying modifiers, choose one focus (an ability score you‘re good at) and one foible (an ability score you‘re bad at).<br><br>

*Focus*. Mark this attribute as 18

*Foible*. Mark this attribute as 8
<br><br>
Set your remaining attributes at 10, and distribute 16 points among the ability scores in any way you desire. You may reduce an existing attribute by up to 2 points to gain 2 points to add to another attribute.
 
\columnbreak

#### Intelligence
___
- **Measures:** Mental acuity, information recall, analytical skill
- **Important for:** Alchemist, Mage, Tinker
- **Racial Increases:** Dark Iron Dwarf (+1), High Elf (+1), Void Elf (+1), Nightborne (+1), Gnome (+2), Goblin (+2), Forsaken (+1) Human (+1), Orc (+1), Troll (+1)

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

#### Spirit

- **Important for:** Druid, Priest, Shaman
- **Racial Increases:** Wildhammer Dwarf (+1), Draenei (+1), Forsaken (+1), Human (+1), Night Elf (+1), Orc (+1), Pandaren (+1), Tauren (+1), Troll (+1)

#### Heroic Roll

This method leads to generally stronger characters than by normal rolling.

For each ability score, roll 2d6 + 6.

\pagebreakNum

## Beyond 1st Level

The rules in the World of Warcraft 5e RPG also include crafting sub-systems and classes (such as the Alchemist and Tinker), and
various options (such as the Infusionist feat) that can translate wealth into character power.

When creating a character from above 1st level, refer to the following guidelines for expected wealth for level to give a general
idea how to keep characters on the same general level of wealth.

Refer to the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table on Chapter 7 to calculate item rarity. Note that crafting an item costs one half the cost of buying it.

| Level  | Typical Wealth |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | 0 (or background starting wealth) |
|  2  | 140 gp |
|  3  | 280 gp |
|  4  | 420 gp |
|  5  | 560 gp |
|  6  | 4,500 gp |
|  7  | 8,400 gp |
|  8  | 12,300 gp |
|  9  | 16,200 gp |
|  10  | 20,100 gp |
|  11  | 24,100 gp |
|  12  | 42,400 gp |
|  13  | 60,700 gp |
|  14  | 79,000 gp |
|  15  | 97,300 gp |
|  16  | 116,000 gp |
|  17  | 134,000 gp |
|  18  | 362,000 gp |
|  19  | 590,000 gp |
|  20  | 818,000 gp |

The amount of wealth carried by a character can vary significantly depending on starting resources, unexpected loot gained in the
campaign, whether or not characters have downtime to gather additional wealth, inherited gold, or even possessing companies
and strongholds under their control.

\columnbreak

##### Magical Item Budget

A DM may refer to the above chart to determine the total worth of magic items the characters have, without actually explicit magic items to be sold.

In this case, the wealth is not the expected wealth of the character, but the cost of the magic items the player should have by the
appropriate level. This can come in the form of quest gifts, a normal item improving into a magical one, or a permanent blessing or
infusion upon a held item.

The expected cost of magic items relative to rarity is present in Chapter 7.

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

##### Expected Downtime

In case of crafting classes (Alchemist and Tinker), or in cases where characters can create magical items (taking the Infusionist
feat), a good amount of downtime to allow the classes to function at a competitive rate is usually 5 days to 1 week between adventures (or the same time for every 3-5 combat encounters).

That way, very complex projects (2 weeks) like building a mecha or vehicle can be done every two adventures.

With such options available, players benefit more from wealth and time to build the exact items they need, from scrolls, potions,
explosives, and more spells in a mage's spellbook, to advanced constructs and vehicles such as gyrocopters, so exercising
judgment is key.

\pagebreakNum

# Chapter 2: Races

<div class="wide">

The races of Warcraft are diverse and rich. Each race has a role in the world, and their deeds resonate through the ages. Members of each race view each other with assumptions formed by past conflicts and alliances. Warcraft‘s history is troubled and epic, and every aspect influences the races, their beliefs and their roles.

The races described here are not the only races in the Warcraft world, but they are the most dominant, influential, and prone to adventuring. Other races can be found in the Monster Guide.

## Draenei

The draenei are a powerfully-build alien race that originates from Argus. They are powerfully magically-attuned, and have the potential for exceptional good or evil. Draenei who succumb to fel magic form the ranks of the Eredar, the greatest generals of the Burning Legion, while draenei who serve the Holy Light are immortal crusaders for justice across the cosmos.

### Draenei Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit or Intelligence<br>      increases by 1.<br>
***Age.*** A typical Draenei claims adulthood around 100 years<br>     old, and can live to about ten thousand
years old.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own<br>     affiliations.<br>
***Size.*** Draenei stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and<br>     average about 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.
As befitting their Eredar heritage, Draenei have hooved feet, tendrils that grow from the neck and
short tails, and their skin color is affected by the magic they naturally absorb (with fel magic
reddening them, holy magic rendering their skins blue to violet, and void magic darkening them to
brown).
Males‘ skulls are rigid (giving the appearance of a bone plate under their skin), while females grow
foot-long, graceful curved horns.
Males range anywhere from seven feet tall to eight feet tall and weigh on average around 300 or 400
pounds. Females stand at six to seven feet tall and only weigh around 170 or 250 pounds when
fully grown.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.<br>
***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness
as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Draenei Combat Training*** You have proficiency with the longsword, greathammer, glaive, and the
heavy crossbow.<br>
***Fel Resistance.*** You have resistance to fel damage.<br>
***Heroic Presence.*** You can spend 10 minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their resolve to fight.
When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:626px;'></div>

yourself) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you and who can understand you. Each creature can gain
temporary hit points equal to your level + half your Charisma or Spirit modifier. A creature can‘t
gain temporary hit points from this feature again until it has finished a long rest. Alternatively, you
may declare use of this ability upon landing a critical hit.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Eredun. The Eredun Draenei speak is an
altered dialect that is less corrupt, and thus does not impose penalties when speaking, but is
perfectly understandable by fiends.<br>
<br>
***Male Names.*** Amka, Doruno, Kozza, Sarhash, Shunn,<br>     Thylon, Voluth<br>
***Female Names.*** Corevva, Daalny, Demetra, Fetwa,<br>     Lan‘era, Me‘era, Tanmatra<br>
***Family Names.***  Draenei do not have family names, but<br>     take a title according to their deeds.

#### Subraces

Ancient events divide the draenei into two sub-races: unbroken and broken, Choose one of these subraces.

</div>

### Krokul (Broken Draenei)

*“You will learn our ways…”*
<br><br>
The Broken, also known as Krokul in Draenei, are a mutated and devolved subrace of draenei who
lived in Outland. They, like most of the orcs, fell prey to the demons' sinister influence and were
changed by the corruption. Though they lost some of their former powers, the Broken still present
a clear danger to all races through Outland. The largest known faction of Broken in Outland, the
Ashtongue Deathsworn, is currently led by Akama. They are supposedly allied with Illidan
Stormrage.

#### Affiliation
***Independent.*** Despite the (mostly) accidental regression into broken, many unbroken
draenei not only distrust them but despise them. Although understandable of those broken who
remain corrupted or in service to the Legion, one would think that the unbroken would be willing
to welcome any of their people that survived the orcs' genocide. Most broken are independent as a
result, although the Prophet Velen, the leader of the unbroken, does extend a hand to broken to
help them find their way back.

#### Krokul Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility increases by 2.<br>
***Adapter.*** You may always act when surprised at a combat<br>     encounter (even if you failed your
Perception check to<br>     notice it). You also have advantage versus weather effects.<br>
***Stalker.*** You have proficiency with the Perception and<br>     Stealth skills. If you already have proficiency
with one of<br>     these skills, you gain Expertise instead.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:566px;'></div>

### True Draenei

*“The Legion's end draws near.”*
<br><br>
As one of the enlightened cousins of the Eredar, the Draenei arrived in Azeroth after the reopening
of the Dark Portal. Living out the last centuries in exile and escape from the Burning Legion, the
Draenei are steadfast champions of the Light, and will do anything in their power to prevent
another world from falling to the Flame.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** Unbroken draenei have found that they have strong bonds with humanity
and dwarvenkind due to their shared worship of the Light, and kinship with the now-mortal night
elves.

#### True Draenei Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength increases by 2.<br>
***Gift of the Naaru.*** You can use your action to channel holy energy, casting the renewing light spell as
if cast as a 1st level spell. This can be used once, replenishing on a short or long rest.
While a creature benefits from this ability, they have a glowing blue mark above their forehead
(shedding light equal to dancing lights). Your spellcasting ability modifier is Spirit or Charisma (your
choice).<br>
***Gemcutting.*** You are proficient with artisan‘s tools (jewelcrafting kit).

## Dwarf

Dwarves are short and stout creatures mostly inhabiting Khaz Modan in the Eastern Kingdoms.
They are shorter than humans but taller than gnomes, taking advantage of their size when possible
and relying on their robustness and strength when not. The average dwarf is steady, observant and
composed.

### Dwarf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Stamina score increases by 2.<br>
***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they‘re considered young until they reach the age of 40. On average, they live to be 450 years old.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own affiliations ever since the great War of the Three
Hammers<br>
***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. Male dwarves tend to have long hair, and beards or facial hair often tied in ornate braids. Female dwarves also have sturdy muscular frames, but they are buxom and lack facial hair, despite the claims of some of the less educated sages of other races.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Natural Armor.*** Your skin is as hardened leather in toughness. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Agility modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.<br>
***Stoneform.*** You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Stamina modifier to the number rolled,

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:591px;'></div>

and reduce the damage by that total. If the damage exceeds any ongoing bleed damage you take, you end the effect as well. After you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<br>
***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with one artisan‘s tool of your choice: smith‘s tools, brewer‘s supplies, mason‘s tools, or mining tools.<br>
***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarven. Dwarven is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

#### Subraces

Three main subraces of dwarves populate the worlds of Azeroth: Hill dwarves
(Wildhammer Clan), Mountain dwarves (Bronzebeard Clan), and Dark dwarves (Dark Iron Clan).
Choose one of these subraces.

### Wildhammer

*“To the skies!”*
<br><br>
As a hill dwarf, you probably hail from the Wildhammer clan and its allies, and live in the Aerie Peak. Wildhammer dwarves are similar in appearance to their Ironforge kin, though many shave their heads and they are slightly taller and leaner. Exposure to sun and high winds darkens and toughens their skin. Wildhammers string beads and feathers into their hair and beards as good luck charms, and paint tattoos on their bodies in homage to the totems, ideas and creatures they revere.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or independent.*** The Wildhammer clan is not a member of the Alliance, but Wildhammer dwarves are allies of the Alliance and would certainly help it in a war (and have done so in the past). They are distant with humans and Ironforge dwarves, but have formed a kinship with high elves. Wildhammers and high elves shared much in common in the past, including a love of nature and hatred of evil. Many high elves have grown introverted and brooding of late, which concerns the Wildhammers. The dwarves are appalled at the defection of the blood elves, an event which has caused them to see their high elf allies with new eyes. They also get along well with night elves, as the two races share much in common.

#### Wildhammer Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit score increases by 1.<br>
***Bravery.*** You have advantage to all saves against fear.<br>
***Mountain Born.*** You're acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. You're also naturally adapted to cold weather in the wilderness or while exploring.<br>
***Natural Handler.*** You have proficiency with Animal Handling. If handling beasts that naturally live in mountains such as gryphons or mountain lions, you gain Expertise instead.<br>
<br>
***Male Names.*** Kazdin, Hagrim, Dondar, Soldrin.<br>
***Female Names.*** Kella, Lorim, Ar-ya, Senica.<br>
***Family Names.*** Beastclaw, Greatbeard, Thundertamer, Windseer.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:431px;'></div>

### Bronzebeard

*“For Khaz Modan!”*
<br><br>
As a mountain dwarf, you probably hail from the Bronzebeard clan and its allies, and live in Khaz Modan. Ironforge dwarves are stout and powerful, with short muscular bodies, and prefer tying their hair (male or female) in ornate braids.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** While the dwarves of Ironforge appreciate the fighting skill of the Horde, it is with grim eyes that they look upon the orcs and their allies, the trolls and the Forsaken. Although the dwarves have held dealings of commerce and diplomacy with the high elves, they keep the people of Quel‘Thalas at an arm‘s distance. While the night elves may share the same allegiances, the dwarves look upon them with suspicion and some trepidation. Humans, however, are the staunch and constant allies of the dwarven people and find welcome, favor and kindness when in dwarven lands.

### Dark Iron

*“You shall serve.”*
<br><br>
As a darklands dwarf, you probably hail from the Dark Iron clans, lead by the Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan. Reviled as betrayers of their fellow dwarves, and living in the mountain-halls of Blackrock Mountain, Dark Iron dwarves are slaves to the great elemental Firelord Ragnaros, and serve him in the latent volcanic mountain.<br>
Dark Irons seem identical to Ironforge dwarves, except that their skin tones are ashen and gray, and their eyes are golden-red. Dark Irons who adventure can often reach into the power in their bloodline and spontaneously conjure flames.<br> 
Hoarse of voice and prone to undertone muttering, Dark Irons do not inspire trust easily.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or Independent.*** Hatred comes to Dark Iron dwarves against all races, and in their service to Ragnaros, they see only rivals, thralls, and enemies. Some dark irons have found kinship with their cousins the Wildhammers and the Bronzebeards, and chose to join the Alliance.

#### Dark Iron Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases<br>
by 1.<br>
***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with firearms and explosives of all types, even if
you do not have proficiency in engineering, and gain proficiency in light armor.<br>
***Fire-Lord’s Favor.*** You have resistance to fire damage.<br>
***Burning Heart.*** You know the produce flame cantrip (caster level equal to your character level).
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

***Male Names.*** Beld, Franclorn, Lokhtos, Grall.<br>
***Female Names.*** Aster, Channis, Mogran, Wellia.<br>
***Family Names.*** Angerforge, Darkbargainer, Firesmite, Forgewright.

## Elf

An elf is a member of one of the longest lived species on Azeroth known for keen perception, grace, and great spellwork. Elves were once believed to be the first race to awaken on Azeroth.

### Elven Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 2.<br>
***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. A high elf typically claims adulthood around the age of 60 and can live to be 750 years old. A night elf claims adulthood and live up to five times said age (adulthood at 300 and live up to 3,750 years old). Until the World Tree was destroyed, the Night Elves were immune to aging effects.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own affiliations ever since the Great War of the
Ancients.<br>
***Size.*** A high elf (and hence a blood and void elf) is usually a little over 6 feet in height and weighs between 100 to 175 pounds, depending on gender. Night elves (and hence Nightborne) are imposing in stature, males being on average 7 feet tall.
Male Kaldorei are very muscular, with broad chests and shoulders, indicative of the strength that lies within both their minds and bodies. Female night elves are lithe and curvaceous, yet still muscular and strong.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Mystic Senses.*** Whenever you make any check related to the origin of magical items, lore, or spells, you are treated as if you have Expertise in the Arcana skill.<br>
***Keen Senses.*** You are proficient with the Perception skill.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:766px;'></div>

***Elven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the longsword, longbow, rapier, and shortbow.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven (any dialect, see Chapter 4). Elven
is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar, even with strange dialects such as Nazja.
Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.

#### Subraces

Ancient divides and use of mana siphoning (or mana vampirism) among the elven people
resulted in several main sub-races: high elves (and the blood and void elves), and night elves (and
the Nightborne), Choose one of these subraces.

### High Elf (Quel’dorei)

*“For Quel‟Thalas!”*
<br><br>
As a high elf, you hail from Silvermoon in Quel‘Thalas or Dalaran. High elves stand slightly taller
than humans do.

The elves are slim, with sharp symmetrical features, often an exaggeration of perfect beauty. The
high elves are uniformly fair in complexion, with white to flaxen colored hair. Their eyes are
incredibly intense in color, seeming to glow with an inner light. While many high elves have blue
or green eyes, violet and red are not unheard of.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or independent.*** Most of the high elves have placed themselves under a selfimposed exile, ashamed of the damage that they have wrought upon the world of Lordaeron with their abuse of arcane magic. While humans still accept the high elves because of the aid that both races provided each other during the most recent attacks of the Burning Legion, many of the other races will only deal with the high elves if absolutely necessary. This is especially true after the acts of Kael‘thas Sunstrider.<br>
The night elves in particular do not care for the company of high elves and in some cases can be openly hostile toward their sun-blessed brethren. The passing of time may heal these wounds, but the use of arcane magic will always draw a rift between these two breeds of elf.

#### High Elf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases<br>
by 1.<br>
***High Magic.*** You know the prestidigitation cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a spell 1st level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the mute spell as a 2nd level spell.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these
abilities (even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities (and after using
them for one hour), your eyes glow a pale blue.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level), they are always prepared
for free.<br>
***Arcane Legacy.*** The high elves are uniquely attuned to magic. You can choose one of the below abilities.
* You increase your mana pool size by 2 mana points.
* You add an additional cantrip to your High Magic ability, chosen from the mage spell list.
* You gain the Suffused Arrows talent. You may only take this if your first level is a hunter.
___
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Mariel, Athaniar, Anandor, Tharama, Viridiel, Malanior.<br>
***Female Names.*** Anarial, Freja, Driana, Coria, Alanassori, Azshara.<br>
***Family Names.*** Boughstrider, Dawnblade, Lightbringer, Morningray, Suntreader.

### Blood Elf (Sin’dorei)

*“Power! My people are addicted to it... a dependence made manifest after the Sunwell was destroyed.”*
<br> -- Kael‘Thas Sunstrider
<br><br>
Following the Third War, 90% of the High Elven population was slain during the Siege of Silvermoon and the Razing of Quel‘Thalas. Prince Kael‘Thas Sunstrider renamed his people the Blood Elves (Sin‘dorei) following this terrible event.<br>
With their homeland destroyed, their forests burned and corrupted, and their beloved sacred Sunwell sullied, the Blood Elves underwent mana withdrawal.<br>
Therefore their culture is more warped due to their insatiable thirst for vengeance: most have abandoned worship of the Light, and
their allegiances have also changed, and most suffer psychologically from extensive use of mana siphoning, due to the Sunwell‘s corruption and subsequent destruction.<br> 
A DM should consider applying the mana withdrawal optional rule with Blood Elves.

#### Affiliation
Horde or independent. Most of the blood elves have joined the New Horde, invited to do so by the Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner.

#### Blood Elf Traits
Blood Elves are identical to High Elves in racial bonuses and names. 
<br><br>
***Blood Magic.*** This acts as High Magic. While you use abilities granted by this ability, your eyes glow a pale fel green instead of High Elves‘ blue. Instead of the prestidigitation cantrip, you may choose the thaumaturgy cantrip instead, and may cast the mana burn spell instead of mute. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:400px;'></div>

### Night Elf (Kaldorei)

*"The horn has sounded, and I have come as promised. I smell the stench of decay and corruption in our land. That angers me greatly."*
<br>
-- Malfurion Stormrage
<br><br>
As a night elf, you hail from Darnassus in Kalimdor. The race‘s prominent eyebrows, long pointed
ears and natural aspects imply a feral grace. Skin tones range from pale white to blue or even ruddy
red, and their hair ranges in color from bright white to woodland green to lustrous black.

#### Affiliation

***Alliance or independent.*** The night elves are members of the Alliance, but they are not the most trusted or highly regarded members of this group of races.<br>
Although honorable and just, the night elves‘ natural distrust has tainted their relations somewhat.<br>
Combined with their mystical appearances and mysterious natures, interactions with other races become uncomfortable at times. There is a strong streak of isolationism in the Kaldorei, for they are uncomfortable leaving the verdant mists of Teldrassil.

#### Night Elf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit score increases by 1.<br>
***Nature Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poisons, and have resistance against lightning and poison damage.<br>
***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.<br>
***Shadowmeld.*** When you are in dim or dark light, you gain advantage on Agility (Stealth) checks.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Ilthilior, Mellitharn, Khardona, Andissiel, Mardant, Tanavar.<br>
***Female Names.*** Keina, Deliantha, Meridia, Freja, Alannaria, Nevarial.<br>
***Family Names.*** Moonblade, Glaivestorm, Proudstrider, Oakwalker, Nightwing, Staghorn.

### Nightborne (Shal'dorei)

*“My people face a similar dilemma. I peered into all possible futures in search for an answer... and found only one.”*<br>
-- Elisande, Grand Magistrix of the Nightborne
<br><br>
As a Nightborne, you hail from the ancient city of Suramar, and have spent your life sheltered by the power of the Nightwell (a simulacrum of the Well of Eternity), and the dome of arcane power weaved by Elisande, the Grand Magistrix. The nightborne look similar to night elves, but their overall appearance is darker. Their skin does not have the brighter skin tones of purple and pink
that night elves do, instead having more pale skin with dark blue-purplish tones. A shal'dorei's hair is also far less colorful than the kal'dorei's, having only white, gray, black, or very pale-blue hair colors. Glowing tattoos seem common among nightborne, though whether these are cosmetic or a result of the Nightwell's energy is unknown. Their eyes glow a light blue.

#### Affiliation
***Horde or Independent.*** When the dome began unweaving after the Battle of Nighthold during the third Burning Legion invasion of Azeroth, the leaders of the Nightborne elected to let it fade, subjecting the Nightborne to the same withdrawal the High Elves face, rather than face the alternative. Electing to join the Horde, the Nightborne found new and steadfast allies in the Blood Elves when they re-appeared in the world of Azeroth. Nightborne that are more independentminded also roam the world, searching for ways to satiate their thirst for magic before it becomes an obsession like the Blood Elves.

#### Nightborne Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases<br> by 1.<br>
***Arcane Affinity.*** You have increased affinity with arcane magic. You can choose one of the
following two features:<br>
* *Augment Weave*. You deal one additional point of arcane damage for each damage dice with your arcane spells. This applies once per spell. You may apply this to spells that do not deal arcane damage, but only once per short or long rest.
* *Arcane Strike*. You can enhance your attacks with a blast of arcane damage. As a [strike] effect, you can add 1d6 points of arcane damage to your melee or ranged weapon attacks. For every four character levels you gain, you gain an additional dice of damage. You may choose to spend them all at once or one for each attack. You regain all spent dice at the end of a short rest.
* Energy Blast. You can release a blast of arcane force as if you possessed the Mystic Blast feat (arcane damage only). You may use this blast number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier before replenishing at a long rest. This deals a number of d4 dice equal to onequarter your level (minimum 1d4).
___
***Blessing of the Nightwell.*** You have resistance to arcane damage.<br>
***Nightfallen Magic.*** You know the mage hand cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a 1st level spell.

When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the arcane explosion spell as a 2nd level spell.

<br><br>
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these
abilities (even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities (and after using
them for one hour), your eyes glow a light blue.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level), they are always prepared
for free.<br>
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Ilthilior, Mellitharn, Lurunic, Elleshel, Mardant, Faldres.<br>
***Female Names.*** Kandui, Deliantha, Allainn, Freja, Alannaria, Macianne.<br>
***Family Names.*** Margaux, Babineaux, Gillette, Clarent, Roux, Prideux.

### Void Elf (Ren'dorei)
*"You have known the Shadow as nothing but horrors. The Shadow sees the Light in the same way. Neither
viewpoint is true. Neither is wrong."*<br>
-- Locus-Walker

As a void elf, you may be drawn from a small and elite cadre of high elven warriors, mages, and warlocks, or have come to learn the ways of the void by drawing upon void mana.

Void elves have extremely pale skin, blue eyes, and hair with varying shades of purple and blue - sometimes with tentacle-shaped dreadlocks. On occasion in combat they fully embrace the Void, shrouding their entire bodies in purple shadow magic (such as when using one of the racial traits).

Alleria Windrunner is the only elf shown to be able to keep the transformation indefinitely.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or Independent.*** TODO - Description Missing

#### Void Elf Traits
***Chill of Night.*** You have resistance to shadow damage.<br>
***Preternatural Calm.*** You have advantage to all Stamina checks to concentrate on spells and other tasks.<br>
***Spatial Rift.*** You can create a spatial rift as a bonus action at any point you can both see and normally reach (by walking, climbing, or swimming) to within 30 feet (or your normal walk speed, whichever is higher).

\columnbreak

<br><br>

After the rift is set, you can teleport to it as a bonus action, it as if using the blink step spell. This is useable once per long rest, and acts as the spell for all other purposes. The rift remains up to 1 minute, and can be used so long as you are within 100 feet of it (so long as you placed it within the normal range beforehand).<br>
***Void Magic.*** You know the chill touch cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a 1st level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the shadow word pain spell as a 2nd level spell. Charisma or Intelligence (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these abilities (even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities (and after
using them for one hour), your eyes glow a pale white.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level), they are always prepared
for free.<br><br>
***Male and Female Names.*** Void elves follow the naming traditions of the high elven culture from which they were selected from<br>
***Family Names.*** Blackfeather, Duskblade, Shadowwalker, Swiftshadow, Velvetkind.

## Forsaken
*“We are the Forsaken. We will slaughter anyone who stands in our way”*<br>
-- Lady Sylvanas Windrunner”
<br><br>
Undead humans and elves freed from the Lich King‘s control during the second stage of the Third War, the Forsaken are a strange and dark force. Hailing from the twisted, skittering darkness of Undercity, the Forsaken are nominally allied with the Horde but serve only themselves. Their objectives are twofold: eliminate the Scourge, and establish a place for themselves on Azeroth.

Four years ago, the high elven Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner fell in combat against the Scourge. Prince Arthas raised her as a banshee and compelled her to follow his command. When the Lich King‘s power waned in the incidents surrounding the Frozen Throne, Sylvanas harnessed her fury and tore herself free from his skeletal grasp. She freed many other undead as well, and
recruited powerful allies from the Burning Legion and the surrounding ogre clans. Sylvanas dubbed her new force the Forsaken, and the undead established their capital in the labyrinthine crypts beneath Lordaeron‘s capital city. Their sprawling, subterranean realm is called Undercity.

As a forsaken undead, your alliance with the Horde started out as necessity and convenience, and your previous life bears witness to the many tragedies of Azeroth‘s reality. Needing both time and help to fight against their former Scourge masters, the Forsaken have a reputation of utter ruthlessness, human experimentation, and moral ambiguity.

<br><br>
<div style="margin-top:420px;"></div>

Although humans make the vast population of Forsaken, there is also a population of high elves
(usually becoming dark rangers), and other races, which leaves a lingering bit of their abilities.

### Affiliation
***Horde, or independent.*** Though the Forsaken do not trust anyone and no one trusts them, they are members of the Horde and, for now, do their best to help their allies and placate their ambassadors. Forsaken have even less love for the Alliance, particularly because they clash constantly with the human organization called the Scarlet Crusade. Some have thrown their lot with the Burning Legion, believing that only it is potent enough to defeat the Lich King.

### Forsaken Traits
***Size.*** Forsaken vary based on their original form before death - those who were medium before death are medium.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to dark crypts and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Cannibalize.*** You can consume the corpse of any natural creature. When you use this ability, you can spend hit dice to heal as if you completed a short rest. You can also mana siphon at the same time. Consuming a corpse takes 1 minute (instead of 1 hour for a short rest). You do not have the other benefits of rest, however (such as regaining ability uses). A natural creature may be fully
cannibalized once before their corpse becomes unusable and without sufficient benefit for another cannibalism.<br>

## Gnome
*“Up and away!”*
<br><br>
As one of the gnomish people of the Alliance, you are comfortable standing with your more physically and politically-apt allies to cover you as you go about your businesses. Proficient in the higher arts of engineering and arcana, gnomes are behind many developments in the intellectual and creative sides of the Alliance, creating spells, gadgets, and vehicles to propel their human, elven, and dwarven friends (as well as their new allies in the Alliance) to a better tomorrow.

### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** Gnomes are great friends of the Ironforge dwarves and have fought and died alongside human soldiers. They are wary of the high elves, but so is everyone else, so they don‘t feel too bad about that. They battled the Horde in the Second War and have a bit of a grudge against orcs, but gnomes are a kindly and forgiving lot and are willing to give the orcs a second chance.

Gnomes and goblins have always been rivals — though whether this rivalry is a friendly or brutal one depends on the individuals involved. Gnomes have not been on Kalimdor long enough to form proper opinions about its denizens. Tauren and night elves both seem rather rustic for gnome sensibilities — but they can make friends with anyone.

### Gnomish Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Stamina increases by 1.<br>
***Age.*** Adulthood at 40, can live up to be 500.<br>
***Size.*** Gnomes range from between 3 to 4 feet tall and average around 40 pounds. Your size is Small.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:560px;"></div>

***Darkvision.*** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Artificer’s Lore.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you have expertise instead of just proficiency.<br>
***Escape Artist.*** You have advantage on all saving throws to escape grapples, bonds, or other movement-restricting abilities or effects that hamper your freedom of movement.<br>
***Gnome Cunning.*** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Spirit, and Charisma saving throws against magic.<br>
***Natural Tinker.*** You have proficiency with Engineer‘s Tools, but it is treated as if your proficiency bonus is +1. If you later gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools by another way, you gain expertise in the skill instead.<br>
***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.<br>
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarven script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Kiggle, Grobnick, Kazbo, Hagin, Snoonose.<br>
***Female Names.*** Beggra, Nefti, Sorassa, Gamash.<br>
***Family Names.*** Spinpistol, Airslicer, Bombtosser, Greatgear, Mekkatorque.

## Goblin
*“Time is money, friend!”*
<br><br>
Goblins value technology as a useful aspect of commerce. Some say that their advantage — and their curse — is to be the primary users of technology in a world governed by magic. While dwarves and gnomes share focused aspects of this gift, goblin technology is more far-reaching and sinister and makes a larger impact on the natural world, and mixes with alchemy in a gloriously unstable blend.

They employ vast teams of engineers and alchemists who expand on current technology and produce gadgets and potions to suit a wide array of applications. They constantly build and repair machines and work on new formulae. Unfortunately, goblins are both passionately genius yet suffer from undisciplined minds. Their lack of focus means that many creations end up half-finished as something else catches their attention.

Goblins hired themselves out to the Horde in the Second War, but now they belong only to themselves and whoever pays the most. Constantly building and inventing requires massive resources, both for creating the machines themselves and maintaining those that actually work.

Cannibalizing old machines only partially sustains this fervent activity of creation, so goblins rely on trade with as many races and cultures as possible. They are the quintessential merchants, peddling all manner of exotic goods for the highest possible prices.

As one of the goblin-folk, you have a reputation for money-grabbing, dishonest work, and unreliability, yet being loyal to money means you always have customers (and a place) in a war-torn world.

### Affiliation
***Independent or Horde.*** Goblin cartels serve as political bodies, and so far, the only cartel that chose to join the Horde was the Bilgewater cartel.

***Best Deals Anywhere.*** Anything you purchase costs 10% less, and anything you sell grants you 10% more of its value. You gain proficiency with the Charisma (Persuasion) skill.<br>
***Inured to Explosions.*** You have resistance to thunder damage.<br>
***Living Better.*** You can gain one of the below abilities.
* You gain proficiency with any two skills of your choice.
* You have proficiency with Engineer‘s Tools, but it is treated as if your proficiency bonus is +1. If you later gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools by another way, you gain expertise in the skill instead.
* You have proficiency with Alchemist‘s Supplies and the Alchemy ability as a 1st level Alchemist. You have to store alchemical formula in a formula book, which you may start out with at 1st level. If you gain later proficiency, you gain expertise to the roll instead.

## Human
*“Go with honor, friend.”*<br><br>
Humans are among the youngest races on Azeroth, but they make up for it by being the most populous. With life spans generally shorter than the other races, humans strive all the harder to achieve great heights in empire building, exploration, and magical study. This aggressive and inquisitive nature leads the human nations to become active and influential in the world.

As a human, your people value virtue, honor, and courage, though like all races they also pursue power and wealth. Humans have spent generations battling dark forces and have lost some of their greatest kingdoms to them. This loss embitters humans, and they have a warlike view of diplomacy — swing first, ask questions later. Aided by belief in the Holy Light, humans have fought the hardest and endured the most during the wars against the Horde and the Burning Legion. You may hail from the ruins of once-glorious Lordaeron, the island-nation of Kul Tiras, the mountains of Alterac, the highlands of Stromgarde, or the rebuilt capital of Stormwind, amongst other nations.

Despite all their tragedies, humans remain hardy and brave — thoroughly committed to building strong societies, reinforcing their kingdoms and reclaiming their nations. Years of war have

### Affiliation
Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them. Most are loyal to the Grand Alliance, but there are pockets of independents, horde-allied, or even those tied to the Burning Legion or Scourge as demon-worshipping Warlocks and Scourge-following Necromancers, respectively.

### Human Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Two different ability scores increase by 1.<br>

***Age.*** Humans reach adulthood at the age of 15 and live up to be 80.<br>

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Feat.*** You gain one feat of your choice.<br>
***Human Spirit.*** You may grant yourself advantage to any one saving throw. After you use this ability, you can‘t use it again until you finish a short rest.<br>
***Skillful.*** You gain proficiency with one skill or tool of your choice. You may not choose Engineer‘s Tools or the Infusion Kit.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elven musical expressions, Dwarven military phrases, and so on.<br><br>

## Orc
*“Lok'tar ogar!”*<br><br>
To their enemies, they are brutal and fearsome opponents, without parallel in their ferocity and cunning. To their allies, they are noble and honorable, following the traditions of a rediscovered past.

The orcs of Azeroth are part of a race that has once again found its true spirit, shunning the cruel practices of arcane and demonic magic for the paths of wisdom and power. Some orcs still hang on to the arcane practices of the past, but their time is fading.

The concept of honor pervades all echelons of orcish society. Even the naming of an orc is temporary until he has performed a rite of passage. Once an orc has brought honor to his name and the name of his clan, the elders give him a second name based upon his deed. For an orc, honor is as important as his clan, and most will die defending either clan or personal reputation. 

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:480px;"></div>

This is a new development for the orcs; before, when led by the forces tainted by the Burning Legion, the orcs were a bestial force barely controlled by demonic magic.

As one of the orcish people, you may hail from the exodus lead by Warchiefs Thrall and Grom Hellscream, and belong to the core tribes that form the new Horde, such as the Warsong Clan, Frostwolf, and Bleeding Hollow Clan, or you may belong to one of the sinister demon-worshipping tribes, such as the Laughing Skull or the Burning Blade Clans. Alternatively, you may belong to one of the clans who have never left their homeland of Draenor, such as the Mag‘har, who are brown in color. The greater the influence of fel on orcs, the brighter green their skin becomes. Some other clans have differently-colored skins, such as gray with yellow eyes (Dragonmaw Clan) or pale white (Shattered Hand Clan).

### Affiliation
***Horde.*** Thrall formed the Horde with determination and sheer will and created an alliance of races that has shaken the foundations of the world to its core. Having destroyed the legacy of Grom Hellscream by bringing the orcs out of the depths of demon worship and servitude to unseen powers, Thrall rules the Horde in Kalimdor with wisdom and temperance. The orcs are as much a part of the Horde as the Horde is part of what the orcs have become.

### Orcish Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Stamina increases by 1. You may also choose one third ability score and increase it by 1.<br>
***Age.*** Orcs mature and age a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around the age of 20 and rarely live up to be 100 years old.<br>
