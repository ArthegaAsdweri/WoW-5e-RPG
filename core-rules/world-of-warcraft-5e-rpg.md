*“The sands of time have run out.”*<br>
*- Medivh, the last Guardian*

Many have waited for Blizzard to approve another conversion of their world to the tabletop playing realm. Alas, many waited in vain.

*“We will persevere.”*<br>
*- The Blood Elves*

However, tabletop players are well-known for their persistence and tenacity in getting what they want to play--or at least, satisfying themselves with an adequate enough replica.

*“Sometimes, the hand of Fate must be forced.”*<br>
*- Illidan Stormrage*

And thus, the World of Warcraft 5e RPG Conversion begun.

This conversion is of the much-loved World of Warcraft Role universe, as for 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons, made by the fans, for the fans.

This not only includes special classes, races, and magical spells, but also includes magical items, and even a few subsystems (such as infusion, mana, and crafting) built in the streamlined format of 5th edition, for the benefit of all roleplayers.

# Introduction

The world of Warcraft has many special traits when converted to tabletop format. It has special naming conventions, languages, and an extensive lore.
___
<br><br>
## Naming Conventions
<br>

<div class='classTable'>

| Old Name  | New Name |
|:---:|:---:|
| Dexterity (Dex) | Agility (Agi) |
| Wisdom (Wis)	| Spirit (Spi) | 
| Constitution (Con) | Stamina (Sta) | 
| Very Rare (rarity) | Epic (rarity) |

</div>

<br>

<div class='classTable'>

| Old Class Name  | New Class Name |
|:---:|:---:|
| Cleric | Priest | 
| Fighter | Warrior | 
| Ranger | Hunter | 
| Sorcerer | Warlock |

</div>

<br>

<div class='classTable'>

| Old Spell Name  | New Spell Name |
|:---:|:---:|
| Delayed Blast Fireball | Pyroblast (modified) |
| Magic Missile | Arcane Missile |
| Magic Jar | Possession (modified) |
| Mordenkainen’s Sword | Arcane Sword |
| Ray of Frost | Frost Bolt | 
| Sacred Flame | Smite |

</div>

In some cases, a spell has a name known for a certain class (such as the warlock’s shadow bolt being known as void bolt for priests), in which case the name is unchanged but the newer is referred to in Chapter 11.

Spells not included in the above list that include their inventor’s name (Bigby’s Hand, Evard’s Black Tentacles) excises the inventor’s name (Hand, Black Tentacles, etc.), as detailed in Chapter 11.

\columnbreak

#### Magic and Mana
Some spells are changed in function or name. All such spells are referred to with their new names, rather than their old names.

Mana and prepared spells are also used as a core magic system, not spell slots. Mana restores over time, while resting, by drinking certain potions, and by using certain abilities. This is detailed further under chapter 10.

#### Classes
As detailed below, some classes gain different abilities to better synergize with the mana system, while others are renamed as above.

#### Corporeality and Etherealness
The Warcraft universe does not transit into the ethereal plane present in other settings, and thus all ethereal movement is incorporeal movement instead.

Incorporeal creatures gain damage resistance to all physical and elemental damage, but not magic damage (arcane, holy, fel, shadow, and thunder). They may also go through solid objects such as walls (treating movement as difficult terrain), but take 5 (1d10) arcane damage if ending their turn within one. They are also naturally invisible, but are not naturally silent. They cannot attack non incorporeal creatures or cast spells, but may handle force effects as normal (such as by pushing, casting force spells, or attacking with force weapons). Force effects prevent incorporeal creatures to pass through them.

#### Damage Types
Besides the normal damage descriptors in 5e D&D, the Warcraft universe has an additional damage type: Fel, which is channeled by demonic power and is inherently destructive and corruptive. It also differs in naming existing descriptors.
Damage types are detailed under Chapter 9.

## Determining Ability Scores

#### Focus and Foible.

This method leads to more focused characters with clearer weaknesses.

Before applying modifiers, choose one focus (an ability score you‘re good at) and one foible (an ability score you‘re bad at).<br><br>

*Focus*. Mark this attribute as 18

*Foible*. Mark this attribute as 8
<br><br>
Set your remaining attributes at 10, and distribute 16 points among the ability scores in any way you desire. You may reduce an existing attribute by up to 2 points to gain 2 points to add to another attribute.

#### Heroic Roll

This method leads to generally stronger characters than by normal rolling.

For each ability score, roll 2d6 + 6.

\pagebreakNum

<a id="beyondfirst"></a>

## Beyond 1st Level

The rules in the World of Warcraft 5e RPG also include crafting sub-systems and classes (such as the Alchemist and Tinker), and
various options (such as the Infusionist feat) that can translate wealth into character power.

When creating a character from above 1st level, refer to the following guidelines for expected wealth for level to give a general
idea how to keep characters on the same general level of wealth.

Refer to the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table on Chapter 7 to calculate item rarity. Note that crafting an item costs one half the cost of buying it.

| Level  | Typical Wealth |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | 0 (or background starting wealth) |
|  2  | 140 gp |
|  3  | 280 gp |
|  4  | 420 gp |
|  5  | 560 gp |
|  6  | 4,500 gp |
|  7  | 8,400 gp |
|  8  | 12,300 gp |
|  9  | 16,200 gp |
|  10  | 20,100 gp |
|  11  | 24,100 gp |
|  12  | 42,400 gp |
|  13  | 60,700 gp |
|  14  | 79,000 gp |
|  15  | 97,300 gp |
|  16  | 116,000 gp |
|  17  | 134,000 gp |
|  18  | 362,000 gp |
|  19  | 590,000 gp |
|  20  | 818,000 gp |

The amount of wealth carried by a character can vary significantly depending on starting resources, unexpected loot gained in the
campaign, whether or not characters have downtime to gather additional wealth, inherited gold, or even possessing companies
and strongholds under their control.

\columnbreak

##### Magical Item Budget

A DM may refer to the above chart to determine the total worth of magic items the characters have, without actually explicit magic items to be sold.

In this case, the wealth is not the expected wealth of the character, but the cost of the magic items the player should have by the
appropriate level. This can come in the form of quest gifts, a normal item improving into a magical one, or a permanent blessing or
infusion upon a held item.

The expected cost of magic items relative to rarity is present in Chapter 7.

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

##### Expected Downtime

In case of crafting classes (Alchemist and Tinker), or in cases where characters can create magical items (taking the Infusionist
feat), a good amount of downtime to allow the classes to function at a competitive rate is usually 5 days to 1 week between adventures (or the same time for every 3-5 combat encounters).

That way, very complex projects (2 weeks) like building a mecha or vehicle can be done every two adventures.

With such options available, players benefit more from wealth and time to build the exact items they need, from scrolls, potions,
explosives, and more spells in a mage's spellbook, to advanced constructs and vehicles such as gyrocopters, so exercising
judgment is key.

# Chapter 2: Races

The races of Warcraft are diverse and rich. Each race has a role in the world, and their deeds resonate through the ages. Members of each race view each other with assumptions formed by past conflicts and alliances. Warcraft’s history is troubled and epic, and every aspect influences the races, their beliefs and their roles.

The races described here are not the only races in the Warcraft world, but they are the most dominant, influential, and prone to adventuring. Other races can be found in the Monster Guide.

## Racial Mount
Each race in Warcraft has affinity to one creature that serves as a primary mount, either to accommodate their skeletal and muscular structure, or for cultural reasons. Refer to the below table for details.
<br><br>

## Draenei

The draenei are a powerfully-build alien race that originates from Argus. They are powerfully magically-attuned, and have the potential for exceptional good or evil. Draenei who succumb to fel magic form the ranks of the Eredar, the greatest generals of the Burning Legion, while draenei who serve the Holy Light are immortal crusaders for justice across the cosmos.

### Draenei Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit or Intelligence<br>      increases by 1.<br>
***Age.*** A typical Draenei claims adulthood around 100 years<br>     old, and can live to about ten thousand
years old.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own<br>     affiliations.<br>
***Size.*** Draenei stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and<br>     average about 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.
As befitting their Eredar heritage, Draenei have hooved feet, tendrils that grow from the neck and
short tails, and their skin color is affected by the magic they naturally absorb (with fel magic
reddening them, holy magic rendering their skins blue to violet, and void magic darkening them to
brown).
Males‘ skulls are rigid (giving the appearance of a bone plate under their skin), while females grow
foot-long, graceful curved horns.
Males range anywhere from seven feet tall to eight feet tall and weigh on average around 300 or 400
pounds. Females stand at six to seven feet tall and only weigh around 170 or 250 pounds when
fully grown.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.<br>
***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness
as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Draenei Combat Training*** You have proficiency with the longsword, greathammer, glaive, and the
heavy crossbow.<br>
***Fel Resistance.*** You have resistance to fel damage.<br>
***Heroic Presence.*** You can spend 10 minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their resolve to fight.
When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:626px;'></div>

yourself) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you and who can understand you. Each creature can gain
temporary hit points equal to your level + half your Charisma or Spirit modifier. A creature can‘t
gain temporary hit points from this feature again until it has finished a long rest. Alternatively, you
may declare use of this ability upon landing a critical hit.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Eredun. The Eredun Draenei speak is an
altered dialect that is less corrupt, and thus does not impose penalties when speaking, but is
perfectly understandable by fiends.<br>
<br>
***Male Names.*** Amka, Doruno, Kozza, Sarhash, Shunn,<br>     Thylon, Voluth<br>
***Female Names.*** Corevva, Daalny, Demetra, Fetwa,<br>     Lan‘era, Me‘era, Tanmatra<br>
***Family Names.***  Draenei do not have family names, but<br>     take a title according to their deeds.

#### Subraces

Ancient events divide the draenei into two sub-races: unbroken and broken, Choose one of these subraces.

### Krokul (Broken Draenei)

*“You will learn our ways…”*
<br><br>
The Broken, also known as Krokul in Draenei, are a mutated and devolved subrace of draenei who
lived in Outland. They, like most of the orcs, fell prey to the demons' sinister influence and were
changed by the corruption. Though they lost some of their former powers, the Broken still present
a clear danger to all races through Outland. The largest known faction of Broken in Outland, the
Ashtongue Deathsworn, is currently led by Akama. They are supposedly allied with Illidan
Stormrage.

#### Affiliation
***Independent.*** Despite the (mostly) accidental regression into broken, many unbroken
draenei not only distrust them but despise them. Although understandable of those broken who
remain corrupted or in service to the Legion, one would think that the unbroken would be willing
to welcome any of their people that survived the orcs' genocide. Most broken are independent as a
result, although the Prophet Velen, the leader of the unbroken, does extend a hand to broken to
help them find their way back.

#### Krokul Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility increases by 2.<br>
***Adapter.*** You may always act when surprised at a combat<br>     encounter (even if you failed your
Perception check to<br>     notice it). You also have advantage versus weather effects.<br>
***Stalker.*** You have proficiency with the Perception and<br>     Stealth skills. If you already have proficiency
with one of<br>     these skills, you gain Expertise instead.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:566px;'></div>

### True Draenei

*“The Legion's end draws near.”*
<br><br>
As one of the enlightened cousins of the Eredar, the Draenei arrived in Azeroth after the reopening
of the Dark Portal. Living out the last centuries in exile and escape from the Burning Legion, the
Draenei are steadfast champions of the Light, and will do anything in their power to prevent
another world from falling to the Flame.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** Unbroken draenei have found that they have strong bonds with humanity
and dwarvenkind due to their shared worship of the Light, and kinship with the now-mortal night
elves.

#### True Draenei Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength increases by 2.<br>
***Gift of the Naaru.*** You can use your action to channel holy energy, casting the renewing light spell as
if cast as a 1st level spell. This can be used once, replenishing on a short or long rest.
While a creature benefits from this ability, they have a glowing blue mark above their forehead
(shedding light equal to dancing lights). Your spellcasting ability modifier is Spirit or Charisma (your
choice).<br>
***Gemcutting.*** You are proficient with artisan‘s tools (jewelcrafting kit).

## Dwarf

Dwarves are short and stout creatures mostly inhabiting Khaz Modan in the Eastern Kingdoms.
They are shorter than humans but taller than gnomes, taking advantage of their size when possible
and relying on their robustness and strength when not. The average dwarf is steady, observant and
composed.

### Dwarf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Stamina score increases by 2.<br>
***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they‘re considered young until they reach the age of 40. On average, they live to be 450 years old.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own affiliations ever since the great War of the Three
Hammers<br>
***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. Male dwarves tend to have long hair, and beards or facial hair often tied in ornate braids. Female dwarves also have sturdy muscular frames, but they are buxom and lack facial hair, despite the claims of some of the less educated sages of other races.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Natural Armor.*** Your skin is as hardened leather in toughness. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Agility modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.<br>
***Stoneform.*** You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Stamina modifier to the number rolled,

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:591px;'></div>

and reduce the damage by that total. If the damage exceeds any ongoing bleed damage you take, you end the effect as well. After you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<br>
***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with one artisan‘s tool of your choice: smith‘s tools, brewer‘s supplies, mason‘s tools, or mining tools.<br>
***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarven. Dwarven is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

#### Subraces

Three main subraces of dwarves populate the worlds of Azeroth: Hill dwarves
(Wildhammer Clan), Mountain dwarves (Bronzebeard Clan), and Dark dwarves (Dark Iron Clan).
Choose one of these subraces.

### Wildhammer

*“To the skies!”*
<br><br>
As a hill dwarf, you probably hail from the Wildhammer clan and its allies, and live in the Aerie Peak. Wildhammer dwarves are similar in appearance to their Ironforge kin, though many shave their heads and they are slightly taller and leaner. Exposure to sun and high winds darkens and toughens their skin. Wildhammers string beads and feathers into their hair and beards as good luck charms, and paint tattoos on their bodies in homage to the totems, ideas and creatures they revere.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or independent.*** The Wildhammer clan is not a member of the Alliance, but Wildhammer dwarves are allies of the Alliance and would certainly help it in a war (and have done so in the past). They are distant with humans and Ironforge dwarves, but have formed a kinship with high elves. Wildhammers and high elves shared much in common in the past, including a love of nature and hatred of evil. Many high elves have grown introverted and brooding of late, which concerns the Wildhammers. The dwarves are appalled at the defection of the blood elves, an event which has caused them to see their high elf allies with new eyes. They also get along well with night elves, as the two races share much in common.

#### Wildhammer Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit score increases by 1.<br>
***Bravery.*** You have advantage to all saves against fear.<br>
***Mountain Born.*** You're acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. You're also naturally adapted to cold weather in the wilderness or while exploring.<br>
***Natural Handler.*** You have proficiency with Animal Handling. If handling beasts that naturally live in mountains such as gryphons or mountain lions, you gain Expertise instead.<br>
<br>
***Male Names.*** Kazdin, Hagrim, Dondar, Soldrin.<br>
***Female Names.*** Kella, Lorim, Ar-ya, Senica.<br>
***Family Names.*** Beastclaw, Greatbeard, Thundertamer, Windseer.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:431px;'></div>

### Bronzebeard

*“For Khaz Modan!”*
<br><br>
As a mountain dwarf, you probably hail from the Bronzebeard clan and its allies, and live in Khaz Modan. Ironforge dwarves are stout and powerful, with short muscular bodies, and prefer tying their hair (male or female) in ornate braids.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** While the dwarves of Ironforge appreciate the fighting skill of the Horde, it is with grim eyes that they look upon the orcs and their allies, the trolls and the Forsaken. Although the dwarves have held dealings of commerce and diplomacy with the high elves, they keep the people of Quel‘Thalas at an arm‘s distance. While the night elves may share the same allegiances, the dwarves look upon them with suspicion and some trepidation. Humans, however, are the staunch and constant allies of the dwarven people and find welcome, favor and kindness when in dwarven lands.

#### Bronzebeard Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 1.<br>
***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with firearms and explosives of all types, even if you do not have proficiency in engineering, and gain proficiency with light armor.<br>
***Resilience.*** You have advantage against poisons and resistance to poison damage.<br>
***Stonecunning.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check or Mining checks related to stonework and minerals, you are considered both proficient and as if having Expertise in either History or Mining (choose one).<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Barab, Aradun, Thorin, Magni, Garrim, Wendel, Thurimar.<br>
***Female Names.*** Chise, Helge, Ferya, Furga, Krona, Imli.<br>
***Family Names.*** Thunderforge, Bronzebeard, Hammergrim, Thornsteel, Chunderstout.<br>

### Dark Iron

*“You shall serve.”*
<br><br>
As a darklands dwarf, you probably hail from the Dark Iron clans, lead by the Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan. Reviled as betrayers of their fellow dwarves, and living in the mountain-halls of Blackrock Mountain, Dark Iron dwarves are slaves to the great elemental Firelord Ragnaros, and serve him in the latent volcanic mountain.<br>
Dark Irons seem identical to Ironforge dwarves, except that their skin tones are ashen and gray, and their eyes are golden-red. Dark Irons who adventure can often reach into the power in their bloodline and spontaneously conjure flames.<br>

## Elf

An elf is a member of one of the longest lived species on Azeroth known for keen perception, grace, and great spellwork. Elves were once believed to be the first race to awaken on Azeroth.

### Elven Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 2.<br>
***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. A high elf typically claims adulthood around the age of 60 and can live to be 750 years old. A night elf claims adulthood and live up to five times said age (adulthood at 300 and live up to 3,750 years old). Until the World Tree was destroyed, the Night Elves were immune to aging effects.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own affiliations ever since the Great War of the
Ancients.<br>
***Size.*** A high elf (and hence a blood and void elf) is usually a little over 6 feet in height and weighs between 100 to 175 pounds, depending on gender. Night elves (and hence Nightborne) are imposing in stature, males being on average 7 feet tall.
Male Kaldorei are very muscular, with broad chests and shoulders, indicative of the strength that lies within both their minds and bodies. Female night elves are lithe and curvaceous, yet still muscular and strong.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Mystic Senses.*** Whenever you make any check related to the origin of magical items, lore, or spells, you are treated as if you have Expertise in the Arcana skill.<br>
***Keen Senses.*** You are proficient with the Perception skill.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:766px;'></div>

***Elven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the longsword, longbow, rapier, and shortbow.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven (any dialect, see Chapter 4). Elven
is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar, even with strange dialects such as Nazja.
Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.

#### Subraces

Ancient divides and use of mana siphoning (or mana vampirism) among the elven people
resulted in several main sub-races: high elves (and the blood and void elves), and night elves (and
the Nightborne), Choose one of these subraces.

### High Elf (Quel’dorei)

*“For Quel‟Thalas!”*
<br><br>
As a high elf, you hail from Silvermoon in Quel‘Thalas or Dalaran. High elves stand slightly taller
than humans do.

The elves are slim, with sharp symmetrical features, often an exaggeration of perfect beauty. The
high elves are uniformly fair in complexion, with white to flaxen colored hair. Their eyes are
incredibly intense in color, seeming to glow with an inner light. While many high elves have blue
or green eyes, violet and red are not unheard of.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or independent.*** Most of the high elves have placed themselves under a selfimposed exile, ashamed of the damage that they have wrought upon the world of Lordaeron with their abuse of arcane magic. While humans still accept the high elves because of the aid that both races provided each other during the most recent attacks of the Burning Legion, many of the other races will only deal with the high elves if absolutely necessary. This is especially true after the acts of Kael‘thas Sunstrider.<br>
The night elves in particular do not care for the company of high elves and in some cases can be openly hostile toward their sun-blessed brethren. The passing of time may heal these wounds, but the use of arcane magic will always draw a rift between these two breeds of elf.

#### High Elf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases<br>
by 1.<br>
***High Magic.*** You know the prestidigitation cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a spell 1st level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the mute spell as a 2nd level spell.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these abilities (your mana pool is considered active, even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities, your eyes glow a pale blue, and for one hour thereafter.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level to access them), they are instead prepared for free.
<br>
***Arcane Legacy.*** The high elves are uniquely attuned to magic. You can choose one of the below abilities.
* You increase your mana pool size by 4 mana points, and you increase your Spell Save DC and Spell Attack bonus by 1 point.
* You add an additional cantrip to your High Magic ability, chosen from the mage spell list.
* You gain the Suffused Arrows talent. You may only take this if your first level is a hunter.
___
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Mariel, Athaniar, Anandor, Tharama, Viridiel, Malanior.<br>
***Female Names.*** Anarial, Freja, Driana, Coria, Alanassori, Azshara.<br>
***Family Names.*** Boughstrider, Dawnblade, Lightbringer, Morningray, Suntreader.

### Blood Elf (Sin’dorei)

*“Power! My people are addicted to it... a dependence made manifest after the Sunwell was destroyed.”*
<br> -- Kael‘Thas Sunstrider
<br><br>
Following the Third War, 90% of the High Elven population was slain during the Siege of Silvermoon and the Razing of Quel‘Thalas. Prince Kael‘Thas Sunstrider renamed his people the Blood Elves (Sin‘dorei) following this terrible event.<br>
With their homeland destroyed, their forests burned and corrupted, and their beloved sacred Sunwell sullied, the Blood Elves underwent mana withdrawal.<br>
Therefore their culture is more warped due to their insatiable thirst for vengeance: most have abandoned worship of the Light, and
their allegiances have also changed, and most suffer psychologically from extensive use of mana siphoning, due to the Sunwell‘s corruption and subsequent destruction.<br>
A DM should consider applying the mana withdrawal optional rule with Blood Elves.

#### Affiliation
Horde or independent. Most of the blood elves have joined the New Horde, invited to do so by the Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner.

#### Blood Elf Traits
Blood Elves are identical to High Elves in racial bonuses and names.
<br><br>
***Blood Magic.*** This acts as High Magic. While you use abilities granted by this ability, your eyes glow a pale fel green instead of High Elves‘ blue. Instead of the prestidigitation cantrip, you may choose the thaumaturgy cantrip instead, and may cast the mana burn spell instead of mute.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:400px;'></div>

### Night Elf (Kaldorei)

*"The horn has sounded, and I have come as promised. I smell the stench of decay and corruption in our land. That angers me greatly."*
<br>
-- Malfurion Stormrage
<br><br>
As a night elf, you hail from Darnassus in Kalimdor. The race‘s prominent eyebrows, long pointed
ears and natural aspects imply a feral grace. Skin tones range from pale white to blue or even ruddy
red, and their hair ranges in color from bright white to woodland green to lustrous black.

#### Affiliation

***Alliance or independent.*** The night elves are members of the Alliance, but they are not the most trusted or highly regarded members of this group of races.<br>
Although honorable and just, the night elves‘ natural distrust has tainted their relations somewhat.<br>
Combined with their mystical appearances and mysterious natures, interactions with other races become uncomfortable at times. There is a strong streak of isolationism in the Kaldorei, for they are uncomfortable leaving the verdant mists of Teldrassil.

#### Night Elf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit score increases by 1.<br>
***Nature Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poisons, and have resistance against lightning and poison damage.<br>
***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.<br>
***Shadowmeld.*** When you are in dim or dark light, you gain advantage on Agility (Stealth) checks.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Ilthilior, Mellitharn, Khardona, Andissiel, Mardant, Tanavar.<br>
***Female Names.*** Keina, Deliantha, Meridia, Freja, Alannaria, Nevarial.<br>
***Family Names.*** Moonblade, Glaivestorm, Proudstrider, Oakwalker, Nightwing, Staghorn.

### Nightborne (Shal'dorei)

*“My people face a similar dilemma. I peered into all possible futures in search for an answer... and found only one.”*<br>
-- Elisande, Grand Magistrix of the Nightborne
<br><br>
As a Nightborne, you hail from the ancient city of Suramar, and have spent your life sheltered by the power of the Nightwell (a simulacrum of the Well of Eternity), and the dome of arcane power weaved by Elisande, the Grand Magistrix. The nightborne look similar to night elves, but their overall appearance is darker. Their skin does not have the brighter skin tones of purple and pink that night elves do, instead having more pale skin with dark blue-purplish tones. A shal'dorei's hair is also far less colorful than the kal'dorei's, having only white, gray, black, or very pale-blue hair colors. Glowing tattoos seem common among nightborne, though whether these are cosmetic or a result of the Nightwell's energy is unknown. Their eyes glow a light blue.

#### Affiliation
***Horde or Independent.*** When the dome began unweaving after the Battle of Nighthold during the third Burning Legion invasion of Azeroth, the leaders of the Nightborne elected to let it fade, subjecting the Nightborne to the same withdrawal the High Elves face, rather than face the alternative. Electing to join the Horde, the Nightborne found new and steadfast allies in the Blood Elves when they re-appeared in the world of Azeroth. Nightborne that are more independentminded also roam the world, searching for ways to satiate their thirst for magic before it becomes an obsession like the Blood Elves.

#### Nightborne Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases<br> by 1.<br>
***Arcane Affinity.*** You have increased affinity with arcane magic. You can choose one of the
following two features:<br>
* *Augment Weave*. You deal one additional point of arcane damage for each damage dice with your arcane spells. This applies once per spell. You may apply this to spells that do not deal arcane damage, but only once per short or long rest.
* *Arcane Strike*. You can enhance your attacks with a blast of arcane damage. As a [strike] effect, you can add 1d6 points of arcane damage to your melee or ranged weapon attacks. For every four character levels you gain, you gain an additional dice of damage. You may choose to spend them all at once or one for each attack. You regain all spent dice at the end of a short rest.
* Energy Blast. You can release a blast of arcane force as if you possessed the Mystic Blast feat (arcane damage only). You may use this blast number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier before replenishing at a long rest. This deals a number of d4 dice equal to onequarter your level (minimum 1d4).
___
***Blessing of the Nightwell.*** You have resistance to arcane damage.<br>
***Nightfallen Magic.*** You know the mage hand cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a 1st level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the arcane explosion spell as a 2nd level spell.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these abilities (your mana pool is considered active, even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities, your eyes glow a light blue, and for one hour thereafter.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level to access them), they are always prepared for free.<br>
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Ilthilior, Mellitharn, Lurunic, Elleshel, Mardant, Faldres.<br>
***Female Names.*** Kandui, Deliantha, Allainn, Freja, Alannaria, Macianne.<br>
***Family Names.*** Margaux, Babineaux, Gillette, Clarent, Roux, Prideux.

### Void Elf (Ren'dorei)
*"You have known the Shadow as nothing but horrors. The Shadow sees the Light in the same way. Neither
viewpoint is true. Neither is wrong."*<br>
-- Locus-Walker

As a void elf, you may be drawn from a small and elite cadre of high elven warriors, mages, and warlocks, or have come to learn the ways of the void by drawing upon void mana.

Void elves have extremely pale skin, blue eyes, and hair with varying shades of purple and blue - sometimes with tentacle-shaped dreadlocks. On occasion in combat they fully embrace the Void, shrouding their entire bodies in purple shadow magic (such as when using one of the racial traits).

Alleria Windrunner is the only elf shown to be able to keep the transformation indefinitely.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or Independent.*** TODO - Description Missing

#### Void Elf Traits
***Chill of Night.*** You have resistance to shadow damage.<br>
***Preternatural Calm.*** You have advantage to all Stamina checks to concentrate on spells and other tasks.<br>
***Spatial Rift.*** You can create a spatial rift as a bonus action at any point you can both see and normally reach (by walking, climbing, or swimming) to within 30 feet (or your normal walk speed, whichever is higher).

\columnbreak

<br><br>

After the rift is set, you can teleport to it as a bonus action, it as if using the blink step spell. This is useable once per long rest, and acts as the spell for all other purposes. The rift remains up to 1 minute, and can be used so long as you are within 100 feet of it (so long as you placed it within the normal range beforehand).<br>
***Void Magic.*** You know the chill touch cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a 1st level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the shadow word pain spell as a 2nd level spell. Charisma or Intelligence (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these abilities (your mana pool is considered active, even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities, your eyes glow a pale white, and for one hour thereafter.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level to access them), they are always prepared for free.<br><br>
***Male and Female Names.*** Void elves follow the naming traditions of the high elven culture from which they were selected from<br>
***Family Names.*** Blackfeather, Duskblade, Shadowwalker, Swiftshadow, Velvetkind.

## Forsaken
*“We are the Forsaken. We will slaughter anyone who stands in our way”*<br>
-- Lady Sylvanas Windrunner”
<br><br>
Undead humans and elves freed from the Lich King‘s control during the second stage of the Third War, the Forsaken are a strange and dark force. Hailing from the twisted, skittering darkness of Undercity, the Forsaken are nominally allied with the Horde but serve only themselves. Their objectives are twofold: eliminate the Scourge, and establish a place for themselves on Azeroth.

Four years ago, the high elven Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner fell in combat against the Scourge. Prince Arthas raised her as a banshee and compelled her to follow his command. When the Lich King‘s power waned in the incidents surrounding the Frozen Throne, Sylvanas harnessed her fury and tore herself free from his skeletal grasp. She freed many other undead as well, and
recruited powerful allies from the Burning Legion and the surrounding ogre clans. Sylvanas dubbed her new force the Forsaken, and the undead established their capital in the labyrinthine crypts beneath Lordaeron‘s capital city. Their sprawling, subterranean realm is called Undercity.

As a forsaken undead, your alliance with the Horde started out as necessity and convenience, and your previous life bears witness to the many tragedies of Azeroth‘s reality. Needing both time and help to fight against their former Scourge masters, the Forsaken have a reputation of utter ruthlessness, human experimentation, and moral ambiguity.

<br><br>
<div style="margin-top:420px;"></div>

Although humans make the vast population of Forsaken, there is also a population of high elves
(usually becoming dark rangers), and other races, which leaves a lingering bit of their abilities.

### Affiliation
***Horde, or independent.*** Though the Forsaken do not trust anyone and no one trusts them, they are members of the Horde and, for now, do their best to help their allies and placate their ambassadors. Forsaken have even less love for the Alliance, particularly because they clash constantly with the human organization called the Scarlet Crusade. Some have thrown their lot with the Burning Legion, believing that only it is potent enough to defeat the Lich King.

### Forsaken Traits
***Size.*** Forsaken vary based on their original form before death - those who were medium before death are medium.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to dark crypts and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Cannibalize.*** You can consume the corpse of any natural creature. When you use this ability, you can spend hit dice to heal as if you completed a short rest. You can also mana siphon at part of the same action. Consuming a corpse takes 1 minute (instead of 1 hour for a short rest). You do not have the other benefits of rest, however (such as regaining ability uses). After being cannibalized, a natural creature’s corpse becomes unusable and without sufficient benefit for another cannibalism.<br>

***Knowledge from Beyond.*** The forsaken are uniquely acquainted with death. You can choose one of the below abilities.
* *Elven Blood (must have been an elf).* You have lingering elven blood in your veins. You have proficiency with the Perception skill, and can gain one of the following racial traits, depending on your elven subrace.
    * *Arcane Legacy (high elf or blood elf)*
    * *Blessing of the Nightwell (Nightborne)*
    * *Preternatural Calm (void elf)*
    * *Shadowmeld (night elf)*
* *Human Blood (must have been a human).* You have lingering human blood in your veins. You gain the Skillful racial trait and a +1 bonus to a third ability score of your choice.<br>
* *Necrotic Touch.* You can cast the plague rune spell. This can be used once until a short or long rest. At 6th level, you gain another use of the ability or choose to heighten the spell’s level to a 3rd level spell. You can make the same choice at the 11th and 16th levels (4th or 5th level, or additional uses). While you use this ability, your hand and eyes emit an eerie green glow.
* *Natural Alchemist.* You have proficiency with Alchemist‘s Supplies and the Alchemy ability as a 1st level Alchemist. You have to store alchemical formula in a formula book, which you may start out with at 1st level. If you gain later proficiency, you gain expertise to the roll instead.
* *Orcish Blood (must have been an orc).* You have lingering orcish blood in your veins. You can choose one talent as per the Warrior Tradition racial trait and gain a +1 bonus to your Strength score.
____

## Gnome
*“Up and away!”*
<br><br>
As one of the gnomish people of the Alliance, you are comfortable standing with your more physically and politically-apt allies to cover you as you go about your businesses. Proficient in the higher arts of engineering and arcana, gnomes are behind many developments in the intellectual and creative sides of the Alliance, creating spells, gadgets, and vehicles to propel their human, elven, and dwarven friends (as well as their new allies in the Alliance) to a better tomorrow.

### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** Gnomes are great friends of the Ironforge dwarves and have fought and died alongside human soldiers. They are wary of the high elves, but so is everyone else, so they don‘t feel too bad about that. They battled the Horde in the Second War and have a bit of a grudge against orcs, but gnomes are a kindly and forgiving lot and are willing to give the orcs a second chance.

Gnomes and goblins have always been rivals — though whether this rivalry is a friendly or brutal one depends on the individuals involved. Gnomes have not been on Kalimdor long enough to form proper opinions about its denizens. Tauren and night elves both seem rather rustic for gnome sensibilities — but they can make friends with anyone.

### Gnomish Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Stamina increases by 1.<br>
***Age.*** Adulthood at 40, can live up to be 500.<br>
***Size.*** Gnomes range from between 3 to 4 feet tall and average around 40 pounds. Your size is Small.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:560px;"></div>

***Darkvision.*** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Artificer’s Lore.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you have expertise instead of just proficiency.<br>
***Escape Artist.*** You have advantage on all saving throws to escape grapples, bonds, or other movement-restricting abilities or effects that hamper your freedom of movement.<br>
***Gnome Cunning.*** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Spirit, and Charisma saving throws against magic.<br>
***Natural Tinker.*** You have proficiency with Engineer‘s Tools, but it is treated as if your proficiency bonus is +1. If you later gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools by another way, you gain expertise in the skill instead.<br>
***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.<br>
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarven script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Kiggle, Grobnick, Kazbo, Hagin, Snoonose.<br>
***Female Names.*** Beggra, Nefti, Sorassa, Gamash.<br>
***Family Names.*** Spinpistol, Airslicer, Bombtosser, Greatgear, Mekkatorque.

## Goblin
*“Time is money, friend!”*
<br><br>
Goblins value technology as a useful aspect of commerce. Some say that their advantage — and their curse — is to be the primary users of technology in a world governed by magic. While dwarves and gnomes share focused aspects of this gift, goblin technology is more far-reaching and sinister and makes a larger impact on the natural world, and mixes with alchemy in a gloriously unstable blend.

They employ vast teams of engineers and alchemists who expand on current technology and produce gadgets and potions to suit a wide array of applications. They constantly build and repair machines and work on new formulae. Unfortunately, goblins are both passionately genius yet suffer from undisciplined minds. Their lack of focus means that many creations end up half-finished as something else catches their attention.

Goblins hired themselves out to the Horde in the Second War, but now they belong only to themselves and whoever pays the most. Constantly building and inventing requires massive resources, both for creating the machines themselves and maintaining those that actually work.

Cannibalizing old machines only partially sustains this fervent activity of creation, so goblins rely on trade with as many races and cultures as possible. They are the quintessential merchants, peddling all manner of exotic goods for the highest possible prices.

As one of the goblin-folk, you have a reputation for money-grabbing, dishonest work, and unreliability, yet being loyal to money means you always have customers (and a place) in a war-torn world.

### Affiliation
***Independent or Horde.*** Goblin cartels serve as political bodies, and so far, the only cartel that chose to join the Horde was the Bilgewater cartel.

***Inured to Explosions.*** You have resistance to thunder damage.<br>
***Living Better.*** You can gain one of the below abilities.

## Human
*“Go with honor, friend.”*<br><br>
Humans are among the youngest races on Azeroth, but they make up for it by being the most populous. With life spans generally shorter than the other races, humans strive all the harder to achieve great heights in empire building, exploration, and magical study. This aggressive and inquisitive nature leads the human nations to become active and influential in the world.

As a human, your people value virtue, honor, and courage, though like all races they also pursue power and wealth. Humans have spent generations battling dark forces and have lost some of their greatest kingdoms to them. This loss embitters humans, and they have a warlike view of diplomacy — swing first, ask questions later. Aided by belief in the Holy Light, humans have fought the hardest and endured the most during the wars against the Horde and the Burning Legion. You may hail from the ruins of once-glorious Lordaeron, the island-nation of Kul Tiras, the mountains of Alterac, the highlands of Stromgarde, or the rebuilt capital of Stormwind, amongst other nations.

Despite all their tragedies, humans remain hardy and brave — thoroughly committed to building strong societies, reinforcing their kingdoms and reclaiming their nations. Years of war have

### Affiliation
Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them. Most are loyal to the Grand Alliance, but there are pockets of independents, horde-allied, or even those tied to the Burning Legion or Scourge as demon-worshipping Warlocks and Scourge-following Necromancers, respectively.

## Orc
*“Lok'tar ogar!”*<br><br>
To their enemies, they are brutal and fearsome opponents, without parallel in their ferocity and cunning. To their allies, they are noble and honorable, following the traditions of a rediscovered past.

The orcs of Azeroth are part of a race that has once again found its true spirit, shunning the cruel practices of arcane and demonic magic for the paths of wisdom and power. Some orcs still hang on to the arcane practices of the past, but their time is fading.

The concept of honor pervades all echelons of orcish society. Even the naming of an orc is temporary until he has performed a rite of passage. Once an orc has brought honor to his name and the name of his clan, the elders give him a second name based upon his deed. For an orc, honor is as important as his clan, and most will die defending either clan or personal reputation.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:480px;"></div>

This is a new development for the orcs; before, when led by the forces tainted by the Burning Legion, the orcs were a bestial force barely controlled by demonic magic.

As one of the orcish people, you may hail from the exodus lead by Warchiefs Thrall and Grom Hellscream, and belong to the core tribes that form the new Horde, such as the Warsong Clan, Frostwolf, and Bleeding Hollow Clan, or you may belong to one of the sinister demon-worshipping tribes, such as the Laughing Skull or the Burning Blade Clans. Alternatively, you may belong to one of the clans who have never left their homeland of Draenor, such as the Mag‘har, who are brown in color. The greater the influence of fel on orcs, the brighter green their skin becomes. Some other clans have differently-colored skins, such as gray with yellow eyes (Dragonmaw Clan) or pale white (Shattered Hand Clan).

### Affiliation
***Horde.*** Thrall formed the Horde with determination and sheer will and created an alliance of races that has shaken the foundations of the world to its core. Having destroyed the legacy of Grom Hellscream by bringing the orcs out of the depths of demon worship and servitude to unseen powers, Thrall rules the Horde in Kalimdor with wisdom and temperance. The orcs are as much a part of the Horde as the Horde is part of what the orcs have become.

### Orcish Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Stamina increases by 1. You may also choose one third ability score and increase it by 1.<br>
***Age.*** Orcs mature and age a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around the age of 20 and rarely live up to be 100 years old.<br>

## Pandaren
*“You seem a little parched.”*<br><br>
As a Pandaren, you are honorable and filled with a love of good company, good food – and every now and then, a good friendly brawl. The pandaren have been content to live in seclusion, allowing their culture to flourish and thrive away from the influence of the outside world.

However, every now and then, a pandaren is born with a thirst for adventure that rivals his or her thirst for a strong drink, and he or she strikes out to explore beyond Pandaria‘s shores. One of the most famous of such wanderers was the brewmaster Chen Stormstout, who set out looking for exotic ingredients for his special ale and wound up an integral part of the founding of the Horde. During the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when demons flooded onto Azeroth and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the last Emperor of the pandaren discovered a way to protect his land from devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left Pandaria haunted ever since.
As a Pandaren, you may have been one of the wanderers that left the misty island to explore the outside world and bring news back home.

Your allies might wonder from where you came and whether they could visit your home, you know that the mists shall only lift when the time is right.

## Tauren
*“Walk with the earth mother.”*<br><br>
The plains of Kalimdor have long been a home to these tremendous nomads. The tauren are a race of shamans, hunters and warriors who long ago developed a complex culture and system of living without the aid of stonework, steel or conquest. This is not to say that the tauren are a race of pacifists, for when they are angered they are capable of retaliating with swift and decisive brutality.
As a Tauren of Kalimdor, you prefer to act instead of talk, and seem to be brooding for most observers. Tauren rarely speak unless there is a true reason to, preferring to act instead of talk. However, once a tauren has learned to interact with a companion, there seems to be a more open and enthusiastic exchange of words.

### Affiliation
***Horde.*** When the tauren first encountered the orcs of Thrall‘s Horde, the tauren recognized the orcs as spiritual brethren. No other race shared such a similar outlook on the world, and the shamans of both races met frequently to discuss the matters of the spirit world. While the tauren see the orcs and trolls as potential friends to welcome, they rarely trust the Forsaken with more than a nod and a place to set their withered feet.

### Tauren Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Spirit and Stamina scores increase by 1 each.<br>
***Age.*** A Tauren typically claims adulthood around the age of 50 and can live to be 150 years old.<br>
***Size.*** Tauren are much larger than other races. Males average 7 1/2 feet tall and 400 pounds, while females are usually a bit shorter and lighter.

Tauren are mostly muscle, having incredibly developed physiques and brawny frames most suitable for combat. They are medium sized.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Endurance.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. You also have resistance against poison damage.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

***Gore.*** You can use an attack action to make a gore attack with your horns. It is a melee unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage plus your Strength modifier. If you used the Dash action before the attack (such as spending last round to approach or having the ability to use it as a bonus action), you may also use the Shove action. This is a strike effect. If you cast a spell, you may use your gore attack as a bonus attack at the same round.<br>
***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.<br>
***Plainswalker.*** Tauren can reach prodigious speed when continually moving. If you use the Dash action once per round for at least three rounds, you gather enough momentum to add a +10 bonus to your land speed, allowing you to travel as fast as a wolf (Speed 40). This bonus ends if you stop moving for any purpose. While benefitting from this speed, you are treated as if you are dashing for the purposes of the gore ability, and also have advantage to saving throws versus exhaustion from forced marches.<br>
***Self-Mastery.*** You have proficiency with one of the following skills and one of the following tools:
* Spirit (Nature) or Spirit (Perception)
* Mining tools or Herbalism kit
____
***Warstomp.*** You gain the Tremor talent as a 1st level warrior. If you later gain the talent, you can use the talent two additional times.<br>
***Languages.*** Common, Taur-ahe. The language of the tauren is often harsh and slow-sounding, which is reflected in the names of their children.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Azok, Bron, Turok, Garaddon, Hruon, Jeddek.<br>
***Female Names.*** Argo, Serga, Grenda, Beruna, Halfa.<br>
***Family Names.*** Darkthorn, Thunderhoof, Stormhorn, Quillsplitter, Stonebreaker, Plainstalker, Spiritwalker

## Troll
Several troll subspecies exist, and they are — almost universally – considered depraved by the civilized peoples of the world due to their brutality, cannibalistic ways, and use of dark magic. Jungle trolls are humanoids that live in Azeroth‘s wilderness, and Ice trolls are known as the descendants of a vicious civilization that (to this day) resists the Lich King‘s dominion in Northrend.

During Thrall‘s exodus from Lordaeron, the Horde rescued the Darkspear tribe, jungle trolls who lived on one of the many islands in the great sea from the mysterious Sea Witch. The Darkspear tribe owes Thrall and the orcs a great debt, and allied themselves with the Horde in gratitude. Their relationship with the noble orcs and tauren has begun to change the Darkspear trolls‘ dark ways. Jungle trolls are sly and cunning, and their society is tribal yet highly regimented.

Each tribe includes a chieftain, who is either the most powerful warrior in the tribe (called Shadow Hunters) or the most accomplished spellcaster (called Witch Doctors); the chieftain leads his soldiers in raids against other creatures.

As a troll, you are often viewed as vicious, brutal and evil, and history lends credence to this reputation. Waging constant wars against civilization and attempt to reclaim past glories is a fervent call for your people, who are seen (and commonly are) a lurking menace in any wilderness area

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:533px;"></div>

and willingly ally themselves with other dark powers to achieve their goals.

Darkspear trolls of the Horde, however, deny this legacy. The Horde has taught them camaraderie, restraint and, to a lesser extent, kindness. Zandalari trolls are also a new addition to the Horde, and unlike most trolls, they have a continuous unbroken legacy of civilization—the Empire of Zandalar, a political entity that stood since the War of the Ancients. This lends them great clout among the other trolls, making their empire act as mediator in inter-troll affairs or when times of great troubles arise.

### Affiliation
Troll affiliations are wildly different ever since the great Troll empires fell.
### Trollish Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 1 and your Stamina increases by 1. You may also choose one third ability score and increase it by 1.<br>
***Age.*** Trolls reach adulthood at the age of 18 and live up to be 80 years old.<br>
***Size.*** Trolls are larger and bulkier than humans, and they average around 7 feet tall and 200 pounds, although their lanky build and slouched pose undermines their height. Your size is Medium.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Darkvision.*** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Ancient Culture.*** You can gain one of the below abilities.
* *Blessed by Loa.* You know the vicious mockery cantrip. If you have the ability to cast spells, this consumes mana as normal. Otherwise, it has no cost to use.
* *Naturally-Attuned.* You gain a favored terrain, as a 1st level hunter. If you ever become a hunter or gain a favored terrain, you may choose another while retaining this bonus.
____
***Rapid Regeneration.*** Whenever you rest or are subject to healing, you can roll twice and take the higher result of any roll to grant you hit points. If this dice has a special effect on a certain result (such as of the holy priest and paladins‘ Light‘s Insight ability), you may either choose to roll the healing twice or roll maximized dice, not both.
You can also regrow a lost limb after a week of losing them, unless the limb was lost through your own will or through magic, so long as you have adequate rest and satiation.<br>
***Keen Nose.*** You have advantage on all Spirit (Perception) tests related to smell.<br>
***Troll Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, and all weapons that have the thrown or ammunition properties, except firearms (unless proficient otherwise).<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Troll.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Drak, Gul, Zol, Vol, Ros, Mig, Gal, Doth, Mag, Ran, Vis.<br>
***Female Names***. Moor, Mesk, Dan, Mel, Shi, Mith, Hai, So, Lith, Arn, Din, Mak.<br>
***Family Names.*** Trolls usually employ titles rather than family names, but commonly take their tribe name as a family name.

### Subrace
Ancient divides among the troll-folk resulted in two main subraces: forest trolls, and ice trolls. Choose one of these subraces.

### Darkspear (Jungle Troll)
*“What‟cha want me do?”*<br><br>
As a jungle troll, you belong to the Darkspear tribe, the Zandalari, or their associates (such as most trolls who inhabit the isles of the Great Sea).

#### Affiliation
***Horde or Independent.*** Darkspear jungle trolls are steadfastly loyal to the orcs. Though they practice voodoo and many retain their savage natures, Thrall lets them live in his borders and generally do what they want. They feel a great debt to the orcs, and their time fighting alongside the tauren has made them friends of these creatures as well. They are suspicious of the Forsaken, but so is everyone else.

#### Darkspear Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 1.<br>
***Dark Promise.*** Jungle trolls have innate aptitudes that usually only show when they develop. Choose one of the below abilities:
* You have proficiency with Alchemist‘s Supplies and the Alchemy ability as a 1st level Alchemist. You have to store alchemical formula in a formula book, which you may start out with at 1st level. If you later gain Alchemy, you gain expertise in the skill instead.
* You gain proficiency with the Charisma (Intimidation) and Agility (Stealth) skills.

As an ice troll, you belong to the tribes in Northrend or high mountains in Azeroth (such as Khaz Modan), commonly the Drakkari or Frostmane tribe, respectively. Ice trolls average one foot taller than other trolls.

#### Drakkari Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Stamina and Strength scores increases by 1.<br>
***Hostile Homeland.*** You gain resistance to cold damage.<br>

## Worgen
*“Get gabbin‟ or get going.”*<br><br>
The worgen's first verified appearance in the Eastern Kingdoms has been traced back to the Third War, when the archmage Arugal utilized the wolf-beasts as a weapon against the Scourge. Arugal's weapons soon turned against him, however, as the curse of the worgen rapidly spread among the human population, transforming ordinary men and women into ravenous, feral creatures. Arugal adopted many of the worgen as his own and retreated to the former mansion of Baron Silverlaine, the estate now known as Shadowfang Keep. The curse, however, was not contained. It persisted in the lands of Silverpine and extended even into the walled nation of Gilneas, where the curse rapidly reached pandemic levels.

The citizens of the human nation of Gilneas found themselves trapped, with no hope of escape. They retreated deeper within the isolated domain, and there they survived, fearful of the savage presence that lurked just outside the barricades. Tensions among the displaced citizens escalated over time, resulting in a civil war that now threatens to destabilize the embattled nation even more.
Records indicate that the worgen, a race of lupine humanoids, existed for a time in Kalimdor. Other evidence also suggested that the Worgen were from a different world that came through portals by Archmage Arugal. More recent evidence suggested that their true origin might have a connection to the night elves and a secretive druidic order from Kalimdor's distant past.

It was the night elves who (by happenstance) created the curse in the first place. Obligated to help their newfound allies, they re-introduced them to the Alliance.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:725px;"></div>

There are those among the Gilneans, however, who cling to hope. Many believe that a cure for the worgen curse may exist, although others have nearly given up, fearful that if they should lose hope, their humanity will be lost forever.

### Affiliation
Independent or Alliance. The Worgen of Gilneas re-joined their brethren of the Alliance once the Worgen Curse spread through their people, but in most cases, Worgen prefer to cater to their own hungers and ambitions.

### Worgen Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 2 and your Strength score increases by 1.<br>
***Age.*** As humans.<br>
***Size.*** Worgens are about the same size as humans when in humanoid and Worgen form. Your size is Medium.<br>

***Darkvision.*** Your curse grants you the ability to see in dark conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Aberration.*** You have advantage to saves against poisons and resistance against poison damage.<br>
***Worgen Form.*** On your turn, you can shift from human form to worgen form as an action. Shifting lasts until you end it on your turn as a bonus action. You also gain the features described below.
* You can roll a 1d6 dice for your unarmed attack when you bite (piercing damage), and a 1d4 for your unarmed attack if you use your claws (slashing damage). These can replace your original human natural attacks.
* You can use the Dash action as a bonus action.
* Any attack you make with your claw can grapple a target if they are your size or smaller.
* Your natural weapon dice increases in strength as if you were a monk equal to your level for your claw attack, or a monk four levels higher for your bite attack (up to a maximum of 2d6 damage if at level 17 or above). For example, a 7th level Worgen warrior‘s claws deal 1d6 damage (from 1d4), and their bite deals 1d8 damage.
* If you have a magic weapon, you can fold its power into your form while you are shifting. While shifted, you cannot use the magic weapon, but can treat your unarmed attacks as if magical.
  Worgen Curse. Depending on your mental acuity, willpower, or predilections in combat, the curse is either a major or minor part of your identity. You can modify your Worgen Form ability with one of the following modifiers.
* Embrace the Beast. The curse more heavily affects your body than your mind or abilities of perception. You can shift as a bonus action instead of an action. While shifting, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Stamina modifier (minimum of +1), although you can only gain temporary hit points once per long rest, regardless of how many times you shift to worgen form.
  Furthermore, when you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike with your natural weapon on your turn, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with your claws, you can also make an unarmed strike (bite) as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
* Reject the Beast. The curse more heavily affects your mind and spirit, enhancing your abilities to track and perceive, but is unable to fully take hold of you. At the end of a long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level. When you are in Worgen Form, these temporary hit points are suppressed, but you gain keen senses, and have advantage on Perception checks that involve scent. You are also proficient in the Insight and Perception skills, and gain expertise in one of them if you are already proficient in both.
  Lastly, so long as you are not shifting, you have advantage to contested checks to track (as if you had the Favored Enemy ability, but not restricted to a creature type).
___
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.
<br><br>
***Names*** Worgen names follow the same conventions as human names.

## Special: Half-breed Race
The Warcraft universe also has its share of mixed-origin characters (or half races), most commonly half-elves (human and elves of any type), half-orcs (human and orcs, or draenei and orcs), and half-ogres (orcs and ogres). Some of the more famous examples are Garona Halforcen and the half-elven Alodi, the first Guardian.
Mixed races are treated as both races with spells, magic effects, and mechanical purposes, but may be looked down upon by their parent races.

The creature usually either falls to either parents' affiliation or is independent.

### Half-breed Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** The creature chooses one of either parents' racial attributes.<br>
***Size.*** The creature is the average in size of both parents (if they are not both Medium sized).<br>
***Speed.*** The creature moves at an average of both parents (if they are not both 30 ft.)<br>
***Racial traits.*** The creature chooses one of either parents' racial traits.<br>
***Racial penalties.*** The creature takes all racial penalties of both parents (if present, such as blood elves‘ mana addiction).<br>
***Languages.*** The creature gains the languages of both parents.<br><br>
***Names.*** Follows the naming conventions of both parents or may be wholly original. Usually, mixed creatures are titled by their ancestry, such as 'Halforcen,' 'half elven', or even 'half human' depending on their actions and history.

### Example
For example, Drann Halforcen, (orc father, draenei mother) can choose his father's (+2 to Strength, +1 to Stamina) or his mother's (+2 to Strength, +1 to Spirit) racial attribute bonuses. The character may then make a decision on which race is he closer biologically to (gaining all Draenei racial traits if the maternal side is dominant, or all Orc traits if their paternal side is dominant).

He would gain both Common, Orcish, and uncorrupted Eredun in either case.

# Chapter 3: Classes
Specializations in Warcraft act as sub-classes for most intents and purposes. Some subclasses are
racially-locked, and thus can only be entered by fulfilling a racial requirement.
Classes in Azeroth have different names (as noted in the introduction), and sometimes different
abilities. These are noted below.

## Optional Rule: More Talent

Talents allows customizing your character in a more freeform way than multiclassing.

With this optional rule, you may exchange class features gained from archetypes (paths, circles, traditions, etc.) to grant access to a talent, but only if the class already has the ability to gain talents,
and only once per level.

## Alchemist (ALC)
*A forsaken stalks the ruins of a murloc village, picking eyes and bits of flesh. As a skulking murloc prepares to jump out at her, she casually tosses a potion at its chest without glancing at it, causing the skin to bubble and blacken with a terrible—the last thing it sees are the forsaken‘s fingers reaching forward to take out its light.
<br><br>
A gnome reaches down to his box of Alchemist‘s Supplies, picking a rare herb and some pinches of sea salt, before tossing them into a small battle-beaker warmed by a portable burner. With uncanny calm, he weighs the curative mixture, before delivering it to a dying friend, revivifying her.
<br><br>
Laughing maniacally as he consumes his potion, the troll rushes into the fight, fingertips mutating into razor-sharp claws. As his muscles grow larger, and as his skin hardens, his eyes gleam with the promise of pain.
<br><br>
A goblin mercenary sits on the back of a drugged ogre, tossing explosive potions. Wincing as a human warrior stabs his giant homunculus, he pulls out a potion from his side pouch and jams it down the ogre‘s throat. The crunch of teeth against glass invigorates the ogre, and, with a burp, it tosses its arm forward with great strength, tossing the human away as the alchemist laughs in triumph.*
<br><br>
Whether by careful measuring, self-experimentation, explosive mixtures, or supportive potions, an alchemist utilizes their own mix of magic and science, alchemical science, to support and heal wounds, decimate enemies, manifest unusual effects, or augment themselves to wade into battle.

These lightly armored individuals are experts in creating a variety of special effects, from temporary explosives to elixirs that revive the dead.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:425px;"></div>

### Magic and Science
In the Warcraft universe, alchemy is not merely pseudo-chemistry—it is an art that draws power from the primal elements of life, not unlike actual magic. An alchemist is a master of the art who takes it leaps and bounds further than their peers, who are limited in their alchemical products to mere healing poultices and anti-toxins, reaching heights of reviving the dead or manifesting massive explosives.

The greatest strength of an alchemist is their versatility. They can themselves adequately but can specialize in being battle-chemists who augment themselves with potions before tearing their enemies apart with their own hands. They can choose to focus on the augmentative powers of their mixtures, delaying harm and healing wounds, or to debilitate their enemies with negative status effects. Damage dealt by an alchemist’s potions usually focus on concussive or poison damage, but they are also broad in scope, dealing fire or frost or lighting as required of them. The better they anticipate their opposition, the better the alchemist can prepare.

The success of alchemists relies greatly on the formulae and recipes they have in their formula books. They gain new formulae as they gain experience, study other formula books, or research independently.

### The Weight of Knowledge
Alchemists‘ lives may appear mundane, starting as a sage, independent researcher under a mage tower, a plague researcher, or member of a military force‘s supply chain. Other alchemists focus on trade, opening alchemy shops and selling anything from curative mixtures to love potions. Others still have adapted their talents to violence, such as serving in mercenary forces or the military, sapping structural defenses and focusing on combat support.

The weight of knowledge and the demand for versatile potions calls for even the most sedentary alchemists to venture out to investigate strange happenings, support their friends, or answer the call to heroism.

\pagebreakNum

Alchemists are students, researchers, and scientists of the mysterious science of alchemy.

To choose to alchemist class is to be more than a dabbler in the art of alchemy—they are utilizers of strange techniques that would empower themselves and their allies, experienced craftspeople who can make potions for fractions of the normal time and cost, and some have even modified their bodies to make full use of their skills.

Creating poisons, potions, special explosives, and empowering substances, alchemists are either curiosities, prized members of society, or reclusive, feared experts in unstable weird sciences.

Alchemy itself does not fall strictly in one end between science and magic, but is a potent force nonetheless.

Alchemists support soldiers and adventurers, and could easily take to the field themselves, brewing and concocting potions, poisons, and poultices to support (or create) allies on the field. Some work to support their communities, others attempt to replicate (or surpass) the work of the Scourge's necromancers, and others focus on self-empowering through strange concoctions they imbibe.

### Creating an Alchemist
As you make your alchemist character, consider the origins of their knowledge: were they self-taught, a student of another alchemist, or did they gain this mastery by esoteric means? Alchemy is a difficult discipline—how did you accomplish the challenge to gain your status? Were you motivated by war, fortune, or by something else entirely, such as the lack of magical talent to become a spellcaster?

Perhaps you preferred the reliable mundane science of alchemy over the unexpected extraordinary power of magic, or took comfort in the fact that you were in demand in an urban setting—there is no lack of adventurers who might need your aid as an alchemist if you do not wish to go out and adventure. Do you have any peers among alchemists? Do they perceive your approach to science as calm and intellectual, or rash but with great breakthroughs or a dangerous form of meddling with life and death that should not be tolerated? Do you have a special ambition or goal to achieve as an alchemist—such as making magic-like effects accessible to the mundane public, providing affordable healing, and counters to common ailments, or are your creations for your own monetary benefit?

#### Quick Build
You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score. Make Agility your next-highest if you want to use ranged or finesse weapons, or focus on throwing potions and explosives. Use Strength instead if you wish to empower yourself in
battle and engage in combat via the mutate spell.

Second, choose the guild artisan or scholar backgrounds. Third, choose the noxious fumes (poison spray), minor alchemy, and fire bolt cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your formula book: burning hands, explosion, mutate, and rejuvenation.

As an alchemist, you gain the following class features
#### Hit Points
___

\pagebreakNum

#### Alchemy
When starting with this class, you have proficiency with Alchemist’s Supplies and can use them with uncanny skill. Unlike most characters proficient with Alchemist’s Supplies, you refer to the alchemist spell list for your spells, not your own spells (or formulas you have access to). This ability does not allow you to cast spells, only to know them enough to create potions. Each level in the alchemist class provides you with 1 caster level to access alchemical formulae, as appropriate to the alchemist spell list.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus. As normal for alchemist spells, you cannot cast them, but can turn them into potions (unless you chose the Innate Cantrips focus from Weird Science). Cantrips do not require a formula book, and are always memorized.

##### Conjuring and Binding
An alchemist can conjure and bind aberrations, constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead, as well homunculi creatures (creatures with the homunculus template).

This is usually done by crafting miniature versions and preparing them in potions or globes of alchemical mixtures.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each alchemist level provides you with one caster level in the alchemist class (minimum 1). You follow the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section). You may not prepare spells, but can brew them into potions, so long as you have your formulae book or have memorized the formula.

When you level up, you can exchange a spell known with another you qualify for. You cannot otherwise change your alchemist spells other than by leveling up and exchanging them, or by training under another alchemist, fiend, celestial, or undead creature (see tutorship under magic).

##### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your alchemist spells and abilities, since your powers draw upon your scientific prowess. You use your Intelligence modifier whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an alchemist effect you create and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Intelligence modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Intelligence modifier

##### Spellbook – Formula Book
At 1st level, your formula book contains four 1st-level alchemist spells of your choice. When you level up, you gain 2 additional alchemist spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research, tutelage, or by deriving formulae from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spell versions of the formulae on your spell list.

Your formula book is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by studying with it and replicating experiments found in other formula books.

\columnbreak

#### Inurement
You also gain the ability to craft unstable alchemical creations at a moment’s notice. Such creations have some limitations compared to normal crafting (as described in Chapter 7), but are more accessible and useable in combat. You also need the required tools at hand (Alchemist’s Supplies).

You also need the required tools at hand (Alchemist‘s Supplies).

Creating temporary alchemical creations costs an Action if a Consumable, or 1 minute if a Creature (such as an alchemical homunculus or an Ooze).

| Level  | Rarity | Point Cost<sup>1</sup> | Material Cost<sup>2</sup> |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
| 1 | Common | 5 | 1 gp<sup>3</sup> |
| 1 | Uncommon | 7 | 4 gp |
| 5 | Rare | 9 | 16 gp |
| 9 | Epic | 11 | 64 gp |
| 13 | Legendary | 13 | 256 gp |
| 17 | Artifact | 15 | 1,024 gp |


<sup>1</sup> You reduce the crafting point cost by your proficiency bonus. You may reduce the point cost by your proficiency bonus (not applied above). Common items can have their point cost reduced to 0.

<sup>2</sup> The crafting cost is unaffected by the Efficient Alchemy feature. Unlike normal crafting, the base crafting cost in materials is not modified for crafting class (x25 for Creatures), and thus innovating a Consumable costs the same as a Creature.

<sup>3</sup> Starting at 5th level, your Common-level temporary creations do not consume crafting materials, but still require access to your tools (Alchemist‘s Supplies).

##### Crafting Point Cost
Your ability to do such rapid and innovative creations strains your mind and creative capabilities. You are afforded a pool of Crafting Points (which act as Mana Points). Similarly to Mana Points, you spend points to spontaneously craft items and regain such points by resting. This is subject to the following points of difference, however:
* You have a number of Crafting Points equal to your Intelligence score (not modifier) plus your proficiency bonus plus one-half your Alchemist level (round down). Unlike mana points, your pool is unaffected by the spell level you can access. As this power is not magical in nature, you are unaffected by any anti-magic effects such as an antimagic field or mana burn effects.
* You do not regain points by mana-restorative effects, such as Mana Potions or resting near mana fountains. However, so long as you are in a relevant resource node or crafting area (such as an alchemical grove or your stronghold), you regain points with a +50% increase, as you draw inspiration from them.
* Your creation costs scale by the item‘s rarity and your ability to craft them; and are thus limited by the Rarity column in your class chart. You can craft anything you have memorized or if you refer to the formula of in your possession (such as in your formulae book).

\pagebreakNum

A temporary creation that breaks down, fails, or expires can be harvested for one-half of the crafting
materials invested. This does not apply to Consumables that were successfully used.
Your temporary creations can be made permanent by paying the rest of the crafting cost.

##### Material Cost
As well as consuming Crafting Points, temporary creations also cost material costs appropriate to their rarity, as detailed above.

##### Temporary Item Duration
Once created, the temporary item remains until used (if a Consumable), until it breaks down (if a Creature), or up to 5 minutes.

Temporary creations are not stable, and if the item is not a consumable in nature, you must succeed on a tool check (Alchemist‘s Supplies) against a DC of 15 after 1 minute (if a Creature), or the creation breaks down.

If the item is not being used by you (or a creature bound to you), it has a 50% failure rate. You may maintain multiple temporary creations, but they all begin expiring starting from the round they were crafted.

##### At Higher Levels
As you increase in levels, creations of certain rarity require less time and effort. The time it takes for you to inure or craft temporary versions of your creations is reduced to a Bonus Action or 3 turns at the following levels for each rarity.

| Level | Rarity | Consumable | Creature |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
| 2nd | Common | Bonus Action | 3 turns |
| 9th | Uncommon | Bonus Action | 3 turns |
| 17th | Rare | Bonus Action | 3 turns |

#### Weird Science

Also at 1st level, you may choose a weird science or avenue of natural talent to focus your alchemical powers upon. Choose one of the following choices:
* *Homunculus.* You gain a companion that is a humanoid, undead, construct, or any creature with the homunculus template. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/2 or lower. See Bound Companions for more details. Your homunculus companion improves in CR the higher your level becomes, CR equal to 1 per every 8 levels of Alchemist (improving to 1 CR at level 4, 2 CR at level 8, and 3 CR at level 16). This either takes the form of choosing a higher-level companion, or adding hit dice to the companion until its CR increases.
  If a humanoid or a creature with the homunculus template, the creature is loyal to you, but retains a shadow of free will. It can be commanded to go against its nature (or what it perceives as its nature) with a DC 15 Charisma check. Bonding with a homunculus requires spending one hour communicating with the creature by means it can understand, and spending the next seven hours in bonding activities (fixing/healing/conversing/etc.). The companion can use your potions as if it was you.
* *Innate Cantrips.* You can use any cantrips you have learned, so long as you have access to your Formula Book. You can use cantrips as if you were a spellcaster, and do not need to turn them into potions or use any resources on them (such as mana or inurement).
* *Potion Slinger.* You may choose one type of ranged weapon (such as crossbows or bows) and gain proficiency if you don‘t already have it. Furthermore, you may spend a potion to infuse the projectile with the potion‘s effects. You may choose to activate the potion before launching the projectile (to take into account the spell‘s original casting time), but the spell otherwise takes place as if the target was hit (or the area it landed on) is the spell‘s original target. You may choose to deal the ranged weapon‘s damage on impact or to only apply the potion‘s effect.
* *Mithridatism.* You gain innate power over poisons. You naturally generate up to four doses of basic poison (as described in the Player’s Handbook) whenever you complete a long rest. The poison’s DC is equal to your Alchemy Spell Save DC, however, and the damage is equal to 1d4 Poison damage per Alchemist spell level you can access. The poison expires before you complete your next long rest, replenishing your store. If you have an empty Mithridatism dose slot, you can choose to fill it with a poison you are affected by, so long as you succeed on the saving throw against it and are aware of its presence. You can store this poison for future use, but cannot otherwise generate it.
  You also have skill in deploying poisons that are in your dosage slots, and gain temporary immunity to such poisons so long as they are not deployed. You may deploy poisons as described under Chapter 7: Poisoner‘s Kit.

#### Efficient Alchemy
Starting at 2nd level, your ability to whip up potions increases your efficiency in creating normal potions. You reduce the base crafting cost for potions from one-half to one-quarter buying price.
This does not affect the costs of material components for spells nor does it affect the crafting costs for your Inurement ability. Normally crafting a potion is also one step of complexity faster. This does not also reduce the cost of spell material components.

Starting at 13th level, this ability also halves the cost of spell material components.

#### Alchemy Path
When you reach 3rd level, you walk a path that defines you as your path of alchemy. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to a path but not yet fully enveloped in it.

Now you choose the Path of the Mutant for self-transmutation and improving your combat abilities, Path of the Transmutor for theoretical pursuits and advanced alchemical effects, or Path of the Apothecary to go beyond morality and mortality and dabble in death and life magics, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Those features include path spells.

##### Path Spells
Each path has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the path description. Once you gain access to a path spell, you always have it known and memorized.

Path spells do not need to be stored in the alchemical notebook.

If you gain a path spell that doesn‘t appear on the alchemist spell list, the spell is nonetheless an
alchemist spell for you.

\pagebreakNum

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Empowered Physique
Starting at 5th level, you do not automatically incur miscibility when using potions within 1 hour of one another.

You may benefit from a number of potions at a given time equal to 1 + your
Stamina modifier (minimum 1) without risking miscibility.

You may, when drinking a new potion, choose to cause it to interact with another potion you
already drank, provoking miscibility.

#### Mettle
Starting at 7th level, your exposure and experimentations in alchemy left your body more resilient to certain effects, such as a rogue‘s poison gas or a stinking cloud spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Stamina saving throw to take only half damage or a reduced effect, you instead take no damage or effect if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage (or the reduced effect) if you fail.

For example, a clay golem‘s reduction to maximum hit points is negated on a successful saving throw, and you take half the effect if you fail.

#### Favored Potions
Starting at 9th level, you gain increased proficiency in inuring potions. Choose up to four potions.

These potions have half the Crafting Point cost, and their formulae are memorized. Furthermore, whenever you roll for miscibility with one of these potions, you can roll twice and take the better result

You may change a single favored potion with one week of downtime.

#### Scavenge
Starting at 10th level, when you gather raw materials for use with alchemy, you gain triple the total value. This applies when harvesting existing devices, nodes, creatures, and dismantling potions.

#### Expert Chemist
Starting at 11th level, whenever you deliver a poison, disease, or potion, you increase the DC, damage, or duration of the effect increases by 2 points or two rounds (if possible).

#### Internal Clock
Starting at 15th level, whenever you make a potion and consume it, you can choose to keep its effects latent until a condition you specify. When said condition comes to pass, the potion activates as if you just consumed it, and costs you a reaction.

You can have a number of potions stored this way equal to your proficiency bonus. If the potion has a casting time of more than 1 Action, it must remain latent for a minimum duration equal to the casting time first. These potions do not incur miscibility, even if consumed at the same time.

Starting at 18th level, activating a potion on your internal clock costs no reaction.

\columnbreak

#### Adaptable Inurement
Starting at 17th level, you can utilize a sample or body part of a creature and mix it into a potion as a Bonus Action, inuring the target to it. If inured this way, the target can use your temporary potion as if it were you. This includes anything from hair, a bit of skin, saliva, blood, or nails.

Furthermore, whenever it uses a potion inured to it, it can roll twice and choose the result when miscibility is rolled.

You are always counted as if you are inured to your own potions. If you could already roll twice on miscibility, you can roll three times instead.

#### Synthesized Potions
Starting at 20th level, you can create synthesized potions. A synthesized potion has the benefit of one potion of a specific rarity, and includes the effect of another potion of a rarity two steps below.

This does not risk miscibility.

For example, the rare-quality Globe of Invulnerability Potion can be synthesized with a Commonquality Healing Potion. This costs the normal cost of the potion plus half the cost of the secondary potion.

You can possess an indefinite number of synthesized potions, but create only one every 24 hours.

<div style="margin-top:390px;"></div>

### Path of the Apothecary
You recognize no boundary of morality or faith in your pursuit of weird science. Reaching beyond the realms of experimention to dissect the supernatural, you employ necromancy, soul magic, and unusual diseases and poisons. Apothecaries usually dress as plague doctors or experimenters, dealing with death and strange occult things for reasons only they know.

#### Plague Zombies
Upon gaining this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to imbue any undead creature you create or control by your potions with any one poison or disease you have.

You may imbue any corporeal undead with up to three dosages of a poison or disease, and allowing the creature to act as a carrier. It can then apply the poison, depending on the poison‘s vector, as below:
* A dose of an inhaled poison or disease can be exhaled as an action, affecting creatures within 5 feet (plus 5 feet per size category above Medium).
* A dose of a contact poison or disease can be delivered with a successful melee weapon attack that inflicts the disease. The attacker cannot add their ability modifier to damage for this attack.

<div style="margin-top:330px;"></div>

* A dose of an ingested poison or disease can be projected onto edible food or drink as an action.
* A dose of an injury poison or disease can be delivered with a successful attack; one dose is delivered with each successful attack.

If you also chose the Mithridatism Weird Science feature, you can choose for some of your creations to host your doses instead of you.

#### Repair Flesh
Also starting at 3rd level, your alchemist spells and potions that heal the living on your spell list can heal undead and constructs (such as rejuvenation and heal). A given creature must be studied for at least one hour before you may adapt your alchemy to heal them, however. For instance, studying a forsaken for one hour allows you to heal all forsaken with the holy light spell if
manifested as an alchemist spell (or potion).

#### Necromantic Mastery
Starting at 6th level, you add all spells of the Necromancy school from the Mage spell list to the Alchemist spell list, and can make potions out of them.

#### Biohazard
Starting at 10th level, you gain the Mithridatism Weird Science feature if you didn‘t choose it at level 1.

If you already have the feature, it is instead enhanced as follows:
* You have a maximum of 8 poison doses instead of 4, and you regain 2 doses when you complete a short rest.
* The poison DC is increased by 2.
* Gaining acquired immunity to poisons or diseases requires only one-quarter the normal time. See the Poisoner‘s Kit for the ability to gain immunities against diseases or poisons.

#### Soul Science
Starting at 14th level, whenever you create or summon undead, homunculi, or constructs via alchemy (as with the conjure spell), you may grant the creature Blindsight against living and undead creatures, as well as constructs and devices that work off an electrical source. The Blindsight only works up to 60 feet, but the creature is not blind beyond that radius.

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

### Path of the Mutant
You push your body past the normal limit—mutation is no mere rage or chemical reaction; it is a secret science only you know. Mutants are often ostracized by society, which sees such unstable people to be dangerous and fickle in their moods.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Mutant Path Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Absorb elements, mage armor |
| 5th | Alter self, berserker frenzy |
| 9th | Fly, gaseous form |
| 13th | Cripple, stoneskin |
| 17th | Flesh to stone, true seeing |

</div>

##### Greater Mutate
Upon gaining this archetype at 3rd level, you treat any mutate spell you benefit from as if it were heightened one level for no cost, allowing certain mutations to become stronger.

You always have the mutate spell memorized.

Furthermore, while under the effects of the spell, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls. This bonus also applies to any homunculus you have.

Lastly, you also gain proficiency in Strength saving throws.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

##### Mutate Potion
Also starting at 3rd level, you can spend 4 Crafting Points to change any potion you have into the rejuvenation spell of the same spell level (up to the maximum spell level of the spell you can access). You memorize the rejuvenation spell.

##### Super Mutant
Starting at 6th level, whenever you are under the effects of the mutate spell, you gain 1d6 temporary Hit Points per step of rarity (1d6 Common, 2d6 Uncommon, etc.). These fade at the end of the spell‘s duration.

Furthermore, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Lastly, you no longer gain exhaustion from the berserker frenzy spell, and you do not lose your action when the haste spell ends for you.

##### Battle Chemist
Starting on 10th level, you gain the Flash Bomber talent. These uses stack with the Weird Science feature (if you already chose it).
Also, whenever you are in the area of effect of the explosion spell (regardless of origin), you can benefit from the berserker rage spell for 3 rounds.

##### Greater Internal Clock
Starting at 14th level, you treat your proficiency bonus as if 2 points higher for the purposes of how many potions you can have active under your Internal Clock ability.

Also, if your Internal Clock ability would activate, you may choose to withhold benefitting from it up to 1 minute. If you do not declare a use of the ability (reaction if not in your turn, bonus action if it is) it fades at the end of the duration.

<div style="margin-top:230px;"></div>


### Path of the<br> Transmutor
Whereas the apothecary dabbles with the line between life and death, and the mutant experiments on themselves, you handle alchemy as a science and a tool, and are considered a more ‗classical‘ alchemist. Transmutors are appreciated in societies, often serving in courts or in magical circles to quantify the true nature of alchemy, sicknesses, and magic. In adventuring parties, they often focus on support.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Transmutor Path Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Fog cloud, holy light |
| 5th | Create food and water, see invisibility |
| 9th | Haste, revivify |
| 13th | Polymorph, resilient sphere |
| 17th | Modify memory, telepathic bond |

</div>

##### Fortifying Chemistry
Upon gaining this archetype at 3rd level, you may enhance any potion you handle for at least 1 minute to grant the imbiber temporary hit points equal to your alchemist level.

These hit points remain for 1 hour, and can stack, but cannot exceed double the target‘s maximum hit points.

##### Medical Expert
Also starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with an Herbalism Kit and the Spirit (Medicine) skill, if you didn‘t already have proficiency. Furthermore, whenever you expend a use of a Healer‘s Kit as an action to treat a creature, the target can expend one hit dice. A creature can benefit from this ability once per short rest.

Whenever you expend a use of a Healer‘s Kit, you can roll a DC 20 Intelligence check with Alchemist Supplies. If you succeed, you do not expend a single use of the kit.

##### Secrets of Alchemy
Starting at 6th level, you learn and memorize how to create a Philosopher‘s Stone and the transmute material spell. You can transmute a mineral once per short rest instead of once per long rest, and you further memorize the alchemical composition of two minerals (as recipes), allowing you to


\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:280px;"></div>

turn one mineral to another. Whenever you would gain an alchemical recipe from leveling up, you may choose a mineral recipe instead.

##### Augmentation
Upon reaching 10th level, you can augment a potion you hold by spending 1 minute or an Bonus Action and 4 Crafting Points. An augmented potion remains augmented indefinitely, but you can only have up to one potion augmented at any given time. You can apply the following augmentations:
* Every dice your potion rolls is maximized.
* Every dice your potion rolls is minimized (lowest result on the roll).
* When the potion is used, roll a d100. On a result of 50 or higher, the potion gives its full effects with only a fraction of the actual content, allowing the potion to be reused.
* You alter your potion to activate in response to a trigger you choose and that can affect the potion‘s contents, such as time passed, being shaken a certain way, or being touched by an eligible target. This does not stack with the Internal Clock feature.
  For instance, if you can create an exorcism potion, you can coat a sword with it to activate in response to touching an eligible target of the spell, or to activate after 1 minute to counter a possible possession.

##### Greater Augmentation
Upon reaching 16th level, you can augment up to three potions at any given time. You can also apply the following additional augmentations:
* Your potion also has the effects of a dispel magic or mana burn spell, with the spell level two spell levels lower than the potion‘s original spell level (minimum 1). If the potion has no replicated spell level, the effective level is instead equal to the lowest spell level the spell can be cast.
* Your potion also has the benefits of one of the following spells: protection from poison, protection from energy, or remove curse.
* Your potion allows the target to add their proficiency bonus to one saving throw of their choice. They cannot apply this to a saving throw in which they are already proficient. This remains up to 1 hour.
* Your potion has a 25% chance to enhance the imbiber with increased lifeforce. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or dies within 4 hours of imbibing the potion, they are affected with the revivify spell. The potion must replicate a spell level of 6 or higher to gain this augmentation.

## Death Knight (DKN)
*Clad in armor streaked with warm blood, the human‘s eyes
glow in a cold blue light as he swings his greatsword with
precise fury, keep foes occupied with him. As he does so, his
allies around him watch as his wounds seem to heal by
vampiric-like magic even as the enemy falls.*
<br><br>
*Standing tall against the oncoming horde, a blood elf
embraces the frozen resolve within to shrug off her enemies‘
attacks. Imbuing her twin shortswords with the power of the
frozen north, her attacks break through their armor with
reckless abandon, sending icy bits of armor, bone, and flesh flying.*
<br><br>
*A dwarf gazes over the battlefield alone, remembering a past life when he commanded legions of
his brethren to defend their homelands. No longer the same dwarf, he raises his hand, binding the
corpses to undeath, once more in the position of command, old loyalties broken in death.*

Years after the destruction of Draenor, the immensely powerful Lich King created a new breed of
death knights: malevolent, rune-wielding warriors of the Scourge. The first and greatest of these was
the Lich King's chosen champion, Prince Arthas Menethil. Once a mighty paladin of the Silver
Hand, the prince sacrificed his soul to claim the runeblade Frostmourne in a desperate bid to save
his people, and having his soul bound for eternal servitude under the Lich King. The rest are
primarily made up of other fallen paladins whose souls were twisted and bound to the will of the
Frozen Throne.

Like Gul'dan's death knights, these dark champions possess unholy strength; they, however, do not
possess free will and their minds are inexorably entwined with and

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

dominated by the Lich King's vast consciousness.

Despite the potential loss of free will, some powerful mortals are intrigued by
the promise of immortality and pledge their souls freely into the Lich King's service to achieve it.

In the years since Arthas shattered the Frozen Throne and merged with the Lich King, the power
and fury of the death knights has only grown. Now these unrelenting crusaders of the damned
eagerly await the Lich King's command to unleash their fury on Azeroth once again.

Unlike death knights of the Old Horde, the Scourge's death knights are not limited to their use of
ranged spell casting abilities. In addition, these tireless death knights are considerably stronger,
faster, and more agile than they were in life. However, both generations are equally destructive and
terrifying to engage in the field of battle.

### Fallen Protectors
Most death knights were once virtuous defenders of humanity and truth as paladins. However,
once the paladin ranks were disbanded by the failing Alliance, many of these holy warriors traveled
to the quarantined lands to ease the suffering of those left within the plague-ridden colonies.

Though the paladins were resistant to disease, they were persecuted by the general populace who
believed that they had been infected by the foul plague. A small band of paladins, embittered by
society's cruelty, traveled north to find the plague's source. These renegade knights succumbed to
bitter hatred over the course of their grueling quest.

When they finally reached Ner'zhul's icy fortress in Northrend they had become dark and
brooding. The Lich King offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty. The
weary, vengeful warriors accepted his dark pact,
and although they retained their humanity, their
twisted souls were bound to his evil
will for all time.

\pagebreakNum

Bestowed with black, vampiric Runeblades and
shadowy steeds, death knights serve as the Scourge's mightiest generals.

### Release from Service
When the Lich King's control of his death knights was broken, his former champions sought
revenge for the horrors committed under his command. After their vengeance was won, the death
knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the
land of the living in search of a new purpose.

The Knights of the Ebon Blade is a faction consisting of the renegade death knights that broke free
of the Lich King's control after the battle of Light's Hope Chapel. Led by Highlord Darion
Mograine, the Knights of the Ebon Blade have allied themselves with the Alliance and the Horde
with the help of Highlord Tirion Fordring of the Knights of the Silver Hand, and have pledged to
do their part in defeating their former master, the Lich King. Their main base is Acherus: The
Ebon Hold, taken from the Scourge after breaking free.

### Creating a Death Knight
When creating your Death Knight, consider your relationship with the person or being that
resurrected you. Do you know who it was, or why they brought you back from death? Do you feel
indebted to them for giving you a second chance at life, or are you angry that they took you away
from your eternal rest?

Death knights often have terrible stories to tell that ended with their deaths. Consider your story before your death—if you were once a paladin, consider the oath you took. Do you remember it? Do you choose to follow those tenets again, or forsake your paladin teachings and follow a new path? If you were a noble or important member of your society, how do you cope with their expectations and your role? What evils have you committed under the Lich King’s dominion? Have you committed crimes that you secretly approve of, such as the murder of a noble who let you down in your old life, or lethally ending rivalries in life? Have you been commanded to use your power to raise the dead, and have you had a choice in raising anyone you once knew?

Also, consider if and how you will attempt to reintegrate with society; most citizens of Azeroth fear
and suspect the intentions of death knights, and might try to sabotage their acceptance. Have you
wronged anyone who might oppose your reentry into society? Will you accept being separate from
all factions, and choose to take up quests with only like-minded individuals?

#### Quick Build
You can make a death knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your
highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the noble or criminal background

### Class Features
As a death knight, you have the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per death knight level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Stamina modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Stamina modifier per death knight level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None

___
- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Spirit
- **Skills:** Choose four from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Deception, and Religion.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a martial weapon and a shield or *(b)* two martial weapons
- *(a)* five javelins or *(b)* any simple melee weapon
- *(a)* a priest‘s pack or *(b)* an explorer‘s pack
- Chain mail and an unholy symbol

#### Special

##### Corruption
Upon gaining a level in this class, you may permanently pledge your soul as well, turning yourself
into an undead creature (permanently gaining the below Undead Nature ability, and counting as
the undead creature type).

##### Undead Nature
You don‘t require air, food, drink, or sleep. You are also immune to nonmagical
poisons and diseases, and have advantage to effects that cause the exhausted and poisoned
conditions.

Also, an uncorrupted draenei who takes on the mantle of death knight may alter their Gift of the
Naaru ability, casting the Death Hex spell instead, as the draenei takes a unique shadow-fel shade of
their Eredar heritage in exchange of the holy powers of the Naaru. This extremely uncommon
sacrifice also takes its toll on the draenei‘s body, slowly morphing their appearance through
extended exposure to fel magic to be more like the Eredar, but turning their skin sickly pale blue
instead of red.

##### Rune Spells
Death Knights are the only class that can access the rune array spell, and can prepare different runes
for strike effects. Runes are magical enhancements that can enhance a death knight‘s weapon
attacks, and can be released in coordination with the Runic Strike ability to cause a devastating
strike.

##### Rune-Bound
Upon gaining a level in this class, you can turn one (of both, if using two weapons to fight) of your
weapons into Runeblades, a weapon infused with the might of the Lich King and his blessing.
Runeblades have three benefits:
* They serve as spellbooks and store spells (as described under Spellcasting).
* You gain advantage to saving throws against any effect that controls your character or alters
  their alignment against the Lich King‘s will while using them.
* The blade serves as an unholy symbol.
* The runeblade is a greater attunement weapon (see Chapter 5: Equipment).
  You cannot have multiple Runeblades (beyond the one you choose or two you fight with). If lost,
  the blade usually finds its way back to you (or you to it) due to the bond you share.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a soothing darkness, gifting peaceful
oblivion of death and whispers of powerful forces, and powerful good brings painful brightness,
shattered memories, and the creeping return of life.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn,
you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind
total cover.

You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its
identity (the lich Kel‘Thuzad, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of
any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

#### Corrupting Touch
Your cursed touch can cause unholy wounds. As an action, you may perform a corrupting touch on a target, investing them with damaging energies. For every mana point you spend for Corrupting Touch, you heal 1 hit point if targeting an undead or fiend, up to a maximum amount every action equal to half your maximum hit points. Amount you heal is instead treated as shadow damage for living creatures (in which case, this requires a melee spell attack). When performing Corrupting Touch on yourself, this is instead a bonus action, and you are always healed by this ability, regardless of your creature type.

Alternatively, you can expend the mana to inflict one disease or one poison of your choice. Each disease or poison requires spending mana points equal to the saving throw DC of the poison or disease. You may inflict multiple diseases or poisons this way. You can choose be a carrier to up to three separate poisons or diseases on your person. You need previous exposure to a poison or disease to be a carrier.

This feature has no effect on constructs.

#### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast
spells as a paladin does.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A death knight can conjure and bind aberrations, fiends, and undead.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each death knight level provides you with 0.5 caster levels in the death knight class (minimum 0).

You follow the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You can change your list of prepared spells by consulting your runeblade‘s runes (treat as a
spellbook), which takes 1 minute per spell level to alter the readied spell.

You prepare the list of death knight spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the
death knight spell list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest by training and
studying your Runeblade (treat as a spellbook). Preparing a new list of death knight spells requires
time spent in prayer and re-attuning to the

\columnbreak

spell-runes: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell
on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your death knight spells, since their power derives from the
strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a death
knight spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier

##### Spellbook – Runeblade
At 2nd level, your runeblade contains three 1st-level death knight spells of your choice. When you
level up, you gain 2 additional death knight spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells
by research, tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your runeblade is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by scribing with runic inks.

You can choose to store your death knight spells in a spellbook instead or as runes on any other
surface as well.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an unholy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your death knight spells, or you can treat
your runeblade as your focus.

#### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.

You can‘t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Defense** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
  damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
  wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have
  the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting**
  When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
  second attack.

#### Runic Strike
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend mana
equal to one death knight spell to deal shadow damage to the target, in addition to the weapon‘s
damage.

The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a
maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is a celestial or a follower of the Holy
Light (or if not a follower, one who merely uses it).

If you have a rune active, you may also perform a Runic Strike without expending mana (called Runic Release),

\pagebreakNum

terminating the effects of the rune (plus an additional effect depending on the
seal). Despite the name, Runic Strike does not count as a Strike effect.

#### Death Knight Aura
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery over aura spells begins to manifest. You always have the following
aura spells prepared.
* At 3rd level, you always have the abandonment aura spell prepared.
* At 6th level, you always have the necrotic aura spell prepared.
* At 10th level, you always have the unholy aura spell prepared.
* At 14th level, you always have the distraction aura spell prepared.
* At 18th level, you always have the vulnerability aura spell prepared.
___
Furthermore, you may cast each of the above aura spells once upon reaching the described level for no cost. You regain all expended uses after a short rest. You may expend one aura use to cancel one successful turn undead attempt that affected your undead allies.

#### Dark Path
When you reach 3rd level, you walk a path that defines you as a death knight forever. Up to this
time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you
choose the Path of Blood for vengeance, Path of Frost for cold disregard for life, or Path of the
Unholy to defy the heavens, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features
include path spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

##### Path Spells
Each path has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the
path description. Once you gain access to a path spell, you always have it prepared. Path spells
don‘t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain a path spell that doesn‘t appear on the death knight spell list, the spell is nonetheless a
death knight spell for you.

##### Channel Divinity
Your path allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity
option provided by your path explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you
choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this
class, the DC equals your death knight spell save DC.

By default, you may always Turn Good, and gain an additional choice from your Path.

##### Channel Divinity: Turn Good
As an action, you present your unholy symbol and speak a prayer censuring humanoids, celestials,
and beasts, using your Channel Divinity. Each humanoid, celestial or beast that can see or hear you
within 30 feet of you must make a Spirit saving throw.

If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned
creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can‘t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can‘t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there‘s nowhere to
move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn.

#### Cursed Carrier
Starting at 6th level, you can carry diseases in your body, and spread them by touch (if contact),
scratch (if injury), breath (if inhaled), or spit (if ingested). You can carry up to three diseases of your
choice with this ability, above the normal three added by Corrupting Touch.

#### Improved Runic Strike
By 11th level, you are so suffused with the might of the Lich King that all your melee weapon
strikes carry his unholy power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the
creature takes an extra 1d8 shadow damage. If you also use your Runic Strike with an attack, you
add this damage to the extra damage of your Runic Strike.

#### Dispelling Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing
creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Aura Improvement
Also starting at 18th level, you can no longer lose concentration on an aura from taking damage,
and may extend the range of any aura spell by 100%. Any effect that would normally dispel the
aura instead suppresses it for 1 minute instead.

### Path of Blood
You are a dark guardian who manipulates and corrupts life energy to sustain themselves in the face
of the enemy‘s onslaught. Blood death knights invoke ancient legends of blood-drinking beings
who are immortal on the battlefield.

| 17th | Antilife shell, death and decay |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Blood Ward
You can spend a Channel Divinity use as a reaction to enhance
any aura you have to resist hostile magic. Choose one school of magic. You can grant yourself and
everyone within range of any aura you have advantage on saving throws versus any magical effect
from that school 1 minute.

#### Blood Strike [Strike]
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, whenever you hit a
living creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend one of your hit dice to regain health.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:510px;"></div>

#### Blood Tap
Starting at 7th level, whenever you use Death Pact to restore mana, the mana restored is increased by 50%.

#### Will of the Necropolis
Starting at 15th level, whenever you are bloodied, you may cast the death
coil spell as a bonus action instead of an action. This feature can be used once per instance of you
suffering the condition, or twice per instance if you are under the effects of the avatar form death
knight spell.

#### Life Stealer
Starting at 20th level, whenever you are dropped to 0 hit points, you may use your
death pact spell on any dying creature as well as undead and fiends as a reaction.

You may also instead tear the life from living targets within 30 ft. as a reaction, stealing a number
of hit points equal to ¼ their current hit points, and restoring your hit points by the same amount.

The target may resist with Stamina saving throw against your Spell Save DC. This may be used once
per Charisma modifier (minimum 1) before requiring a long rest.

### Path of Frost
You are a harbinger of doom, channeling runic power and delivering freezing weapon strikes. Frost
death knights are terrors of the frozen wastes.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Path of Frost Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Icy touch, rune array (frozen wastes) |
| 5th | Hold, consecration/desecration |
| 9th | Blizzard |
| 13th | Blight, ice storm |
| 17th | Cone of cold (howling blast), cripple |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Freeze
You can spend a Channel Divinity use as an action to cause enemies
within a 20-foot radius to be wracked with unbearable pain as you freeze their blood. The targets
must succeed a Charisma save or suffer Disadvantage to all attack rolls and skill checks, and move
at half movement while in the affected area. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Death
Knight level. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn every round.

#### Frost Presence
Starting when you gain this archetype at 3rd level, whenever you deal cold damage
through a death knight spell or ability, you deal extra cold damage equal to your proficiency bonus,

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

applying once per round. You also gain resistance to cold damage.

#### Might of the Wastes [Strike]
Starting at 7th level, your frost-sharpened weapons land a critical hit
on a roll of 19 or 20 as a strike effect. You also deal an additional 1d4 points of cold damage
whenever you strike an enemy with this. You may also add the extra damage from your Frost
Presence ability to this. Despite being a strike effect, you can make an off-hand attack with a Bonus
Action and still maintain this strike effect.

#### Frozen Soul
Starting at 15th level, whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points from a cold
spell, or if they under the effects of your Freeze channel divinity, your next Runic Strike within 1
hour has no mana cost. You may also choose to deal half of your Runic Strike‘s extra damage as
cold damage. If you choose to do so, you may add half the bonus to damage from your Frost
Presence ability. If you are under the effects of the avatar form death knight spell, your next two
Runic Strikes within 1 hour have no mana cost.

#### Pillar of Frost
Starting at 20th level, supernatural ice hangs heavy on your body. This increases
your strength score by 4 to a max of 24 and your Stamina by 2 to a max of 22.

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Bolster Undead
You can use a Channel Divinity use to guard undead against
being turned, as well as empowering them. All and any undead under your command within 30 ft.
of you may add your Proficiency bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for one
minute, and may ignore one Turn Undead attempt. This does not stack with their own proficiency
bonuses.

You cannot benefit from the numeric bonus, even if you are undead, but can resist one Turn

Undead attempt as normal. This bonus remains for ten minutes.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:500px;"></div>

#### Undead Companion
At 3rd level, you gain a bound companion that accompanies you on your
adventures and can fight alongside you. The companion must be an undead that is no larger than
Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower (for example, a lesser ghoul). See Bound
Companion for more details.

#### Bond
Due to your bond with the creature, you can add your proficiency bonus to the undead‘s AC,
attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. This does
not stack with their own proficiency bonuses.

Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your death knight level,
whichever is higher. The creature benefits from Bolster Undead the same way you do.

#### Leveling up
Your undead companion improves in CR the higher your level becomes, CR equal to 1 per every 8
levels of Death Knight (improving to 1 CR at level 4, 2 CR at level 8, and 3 CR at level 16). This
either takes the form of choosing a higher-level companion, or adding hit dice to the companion
until its CR increases.

When reaching 8th level, you can choose a Large creature. The companion also gains an Ability
Score Improvement once you do (this acts as the normal feature).

#### Special
Bonding with an undead requires spending one hour animating it, and the next hour drawing from
any superficial memories before its death. You can apply the skeletal or zombie monster template to
any creature that qualifies and

can be subject to animation by casting the bind spell on them.


You may also raise your enemies to serve as undead companions, so long as their CR are within the
described guidelines (treat 1 level as 1 CR).

#### Grave March
At 7th level, your auras increase in strength. You may maintain two aura spells at
once as if they were one spell. Furthermore, your allies can also benefit from two auras at a time, so
long as one of these spells is the Unholy Aura spell. The maximum duration of your unholy aura
spell is 4 hours instead of 1.

Also, whenever in a forced march, all creatures under your unholy aura spell have advantage to
saving throws to continue a march without suffering exhaustion, and can move at a fast pace
without incurring a penalty to their Passive Spirit (Perception) score.

#### Army of the Dead
Starting at 15th level, your conjure undead (animate undead) spells are inherently
stronger than others. You may cast the conjure undead spell as an action instead of 1 minute when
conjuring undead. Once this feature is used, it cannot be used again until after a short rest.

If you cast the spell with its full casting time, a number of zombies arise to fight for you and protect
you while you focus on casting the spell. The number of zombies is equal to 2 per spell level, so far
as there are sufficient corpses within 30 feet.

These temporary undead followers are friendly to you and your allies, and are controlled as normal
summons, but do not count against your limit of summoned undead. The DM has the zombies‘
statistics. Once the spell‘s casting time ends and you successfully cast the conjure undead spell, you
can use an action to maintain the additional zombies. The additional zombies cannot remain more
than 10 minutes. If you lose concentration on the spell, you also lose concentration on the
zombies, and they stop animating.

Furthermore, if you do not have the required number of corpses (the required material focus) for
animating undead, you use corpses from any place so long as you are within 1 mile of a graveyard,
mass grave, battlefield, or any location with sufficient number of corpses so long as they are not on
hallowed ground. The earth must be loose enough for the zombies to dig their way out. The
temporary undead you create from casting conjure undead require the corpses to be within 30 feet,
however.

#### Unholy Champion
Starting at 20th level, you gain the avatar form death knight spell for no cost if
you didn‘t already have it. Furthermore, you augment the spell in the following ways:
* You are instantly healed for 3d8 + 10 hit points. The healing increases by 1d8 per spell
  level above 3rd.
* You become resistant to damage from good aligned targets (or magical weapons) as well as
  to shadow damage.
* Any undead within any active aura you have regains 2d6 hit points every round. This
  cannot exceed half their total hit points.

## Druid (DRD)
*The night elf notices a broken blade of familiar design, and
then a disturbance in the distance. She rises, and runs toward
the sound, leaping through the forest expertly and silently. As
she comes to a waterfall, she leaps off the edge of the cliff, a
wave of purple mist enveloping her, as she shapeshifts into a
saber cat, prepared for further pursuit.*
<br><br>
*An ancient troll stands quietly atop an equally old ziggurat, eyes
narrowing against the bright red sunrise. In the distance, the
waves bring the promise of war as ships sail towards his
homeland. He speaks a prayer to the Loa, before shapeshifting
into a leathery-winged primordial pterrordax, and rising upon the winds to scout the danger
approaching his home.*
<br><br>
*A worgen stalks the forest, hunting her quarry, smelling blood. She emerges to a worgen stirred
into a blood-frenzy upon a wounded human, prepared to bite it. She shouts, causing the mindless
beast to turn to her. She raises her hand, bringing a pillar of moonlight down, searing the worgen‘s
fur. As the blinding light subsides, an unconscious human lies on the grass, curse overwhelmed by
the moon-goddess‘s holy strength.*
<br><br>
Druids are keepers of the world who walk the path of nature, following the wisdom of the Ancients
and Cenarius, healing and nurturing the world. To druids, nature is a delicate balance of actions in
which even the smallest imbalance can create storming turmoil from peaceful skies. Druids draw
their power from this natural energy, using it to change their shapes and command the forces of
nature. Traditionally, druids chose the path of a specific animal totem. Since the invasion of the
Burning Legion, however, most druids have undergone a number of reforms, including
encouraging the study of magic from all totems. Druids who do this are known as druids of the
wild.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:460px;"></div>

### Balance and Harmony
Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience,
druids can unleash nature‘s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a
great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones.

Druids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies. They are deeply in
tune with the animal spirits of Azeroth. As master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a
variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, storm crow, or sea lion with ease. This flexibility allows
them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and
surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. These keepers of the natural order are among the
most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a
moment‘s notice.

Cenarius is the patron entity of all druids. However, each group of druids has its own special
patrons and some even have the ability to transform into a being that looks like their patron. Many
druids take on an animal companion based on their patron.

### Call of the Wild
A druid's empathy with the creatures of the wild also allows him to shapeshift into the forms of
other animals. For example, a wounded druid whose magical energies are running low might
abruptly take on the form of a bear in order to better withstand further injury. Alternatively, the
druid might shift into the form of some large cat, sneak up behind an enemy, then pounce and
deliver a fierce flurry of melee attacks. Even the deepest oceans can be explored by a druid, who can
simply shift into an aquatic creature, allowing him to stay underwater as long as needed.

\pagebreakNum

Druids come and go as they please, and their goals typically have little to do with the ‗civilized‘
world. Unaffiliated with any specific government, the primary druidic organization on Azeroth, the
Cenarion Circle, answers to no one but itself.

The highest rank that a druid can have is that of archdruid, and there are only a few archdruids on
Azeroth. At the moment the Cenarion Circle's leader is Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, also
widely considered to be the first (and greatest) mortal druid on Azeroth.

### Creating a Druid
When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps
your character lives in a society where druidism still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being
abandoned in the depths of a forest, or burdened by a terrible curse to which druidism was a cure.

Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face
with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during
an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was
part of your character's destiny.

Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a
caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up
an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience,
druids can unleash nature‘s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a
great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones.

The druids of Azeroth nearly all belong to the circle of Cenarius. Druids otherwise corrupted still
belong to the same circle. Azerothian druids are more limited in the shapes they may choose when
transforming, but they gain an additional ability to empower said form.

#### Quick Build
You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Spirit should be your highest
ability score, followed by Stamina. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the gust,
thorn whip, and wrath cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your idol: primal roar
(abandonment aura), charm (beast), conjure (beast), entangling roots, faerie fire, and rejuvenation.

#### Druidic
You know druidic, the secret language of druids, fey, and spirits of the wild. You can speak the
language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language
automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message‘s presence with a successful DC 15
Spirit (Perception) check but can‘t decipher it without magic. If you can speak druidic, you can
communicate one-way with all other druids and fey creatures, even if you don‘t otherwise share a
language. Natural beasts understand simple commands in druidic.

#### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A druid can conjure and bind aberrations, beasts, elementals, fey, oozes, and plants.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each druid level provides you with 1 caster level in the druid class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell
list. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest by meditating in
nature and consulting your druidic idol (treat as a spellbook). Preparing a new list of druid spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

##### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your
idol. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Spirit is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion
and attunement to nature. You use your Spirit whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Spirit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier

##### Spellbook – Idol
At 1st level, your idol contains six 1st-level druid spells of your choice. When you level up, you gain
2 additional druid spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research, tutelage, or
from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your idol is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by meditating with it and inhaling
herbal vapors.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic idol as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

#### Druid Circle
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Balance to preserve the
order of nature, the Circle of the Feral Beast to act within nature‘s order, or the Circle of
Restoration to keep and preserve living things, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your
choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you may choose a land-bound beast to morph into as an action. You can use
this feature twice before requiring a short or long rest. The creature selected can be any beast that
cannot fly or swim naturally, such as a wolf, lion, bear, tiger, etc. You remain in this form a number
of hours equal to half your druid level (round down).

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert
to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you
fall unconscious (unless if sleeping by your own volition, such as by resting or the slumber spell),
drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your
  alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Spirit, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your
  skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.
* If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than
  yours, use the creature‘s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions,
  you can't use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast‘s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to
  your normal form, you retain the percentage of hit points your wild shape form ended with, but
  this cannot reduce your hit points by more than one-quarter your hit point total (for instance, wild
  shaping to a creature at full hit points and ending the spell at 0 hit points reduces your current hit
  points by one-quarter). If the spell ended from your hit points being reduced to 0 or below, you
  revert back automatically, and reduce your current hit points by one-quarter as described.
* You can‘t cast spells unless those noted by other abilities, and your ability to speak or take
  any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming
  doesn‘t break your concentration on a spell you‘ve already cast, however, or prevent you from
  taking actions that are part of a spell (such as call lightning) that you‘ve already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use
  them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can‘t use any of your special
  senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your
  new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is
  practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature‘s shape and size.
  Your equipment doesn‘t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the
  new form can‘t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with
  the form has no effect until you leave the form.

\pagebreakNum

Starting at 4th level, you may choose a creature with natural swimming capabilities and underwater
breathing, such as a sea lion, a seal, a fish, a shark, etc.
At 8th level, you may choose a creature with natural flying capabilities (such as giant eagles,
dragonhawks, storm-crows, or vultures) to the list of creatures you can transform to.
At 12th level, you may take the form of a tree or plant creature, and add minor ancients to the list
of creatures you can transform to.
The chosen creature forms are equal to your Spirit modifier from each category (land, water, air,
and plant), and the suite cannot be changed later except when leveling up (in which case you may
choose a new suite of creatures for each category). Creatures you may transform to have a
maximum CR of your hit dice divided by 8 (¼ at level 2, ½ at level 4, 1 at level 8, and 2 at level
16).

#### Ancient Power
Starting at 2nd level, you may rapidly recover your mana by invoking ancient powers. You can use your action and bonus action on your turn to regain up to 20 mana points.

You replenish your reserve of ancient power when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, natural energies suffuse you, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting you advantage to saving throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Timeless
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10
actual years you live, your body ages one year only.

#### Beast Spells
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild
Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape,
but you aren‘t able to provide material components.

#### Archdruid
At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can
ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components
that lack a cost and aren‘t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape
and your various Wild Shapes.

<div style="margin-top:290px;"></div>

### Balance
You achieve a balance between the powers and influence of the moon and sun. Balance druids
usually stand in the back lines, invigorating their allies and calling down shooting stars on their
foes.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Balance Circle Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Barkskin, entangling roots |
| 5th | Call lightning, plant growth |
| 7th | Divination, freedom of movement |
| 9th | Commune with nature, tree stride |

</div>

#### Eclipse Pool
Starting at 2nd level, whenever you successfully deal arcane or holy damage to an
enemy through a Druidic spell or ability, you gain one Eclipse point. You cannot gain more than
one per round. This also applies once per spell, not once per target or sigil pulse. Eclipse points are
used to empower your abilities.

For every Eclipse point you have, you may deal an additional 1 point of arcane or holy damage per
dice of the spell, if the spells or abilities deals arcane or holy damage. You may have a maximum
number of eclipse points equal to 2 plus your Proficiency bonus, and they remain for one hour
after being acquired.

#### Balance of Sun and Moon
Also starting at 2nd level, you may expend one Eclipse point when
casting a spell that deals arcane or holy damage to apply one of the following effects:
* Deal 2d6 extra points of damage of that type atop the normal bonus
* Cast the wrath cantrip as a bonus action. On a successful hit with the cantrip, you regain
  the Eclipse point.

#### Moonkin
Starting at 6th level, you may always transform into a wildkin when wild shaping.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:340px;"></div>

Furthermore, when transformed to a wildkin, you may still cast druidic spells of the Transmutation
and Evocation schools. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells of the
Transmutation and Evocation schools while in a beast shape, but you aren‘t able to provide
material components. Furthermore, you gain three Eclipse points when you enter this form.

When in this form or while under the effects of the avatar form spell, such spells cost 1 mana less
than normal. Once you gain the Beast Spells druid feature of 18th level, you can cast spells as
normal, but you still benefit from the mana cost reduction for those specific spell schools.

Shooting Star. Starting at 10th level, you may reroll the damage roll for any druid spell you cast by
expending an Eclipse Point. If the dice‘s roll is the maximum possible result (6 on d6, 4 on d4,
etc.), you may roll again and add that damage to the total.

Also, while under the effects of the avatar form spell, whenever you spend an Eclipse point, roll a
1d4. On a roll of a 4, it is not spent.

#### World in Balance
Starting at 14th level, you can command the world to hear your call, and call a
solar or lunar eclipse (depending on the time). Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again
until after a long rest.

#### Solar Eclipse (Day only)
The sun‘s light is covered by a shadow which blankets the earth in a 5-mile
radius centered on the druid for one hour. The area becomes dim light or normal light (your
choice), and creatures sensitive to sunlight do not take penalties from sunlight. All your druid spells
that deal arcane damage do so as if your Eclipse pool was full. You also gain one Eclipse Point per
minute.

#### Lunar Eclipse (Night only)
The moon‘s light is bright and cloaked in the shadow which blankets the
earth in a 5-mile radius centered on the druid for one hour. The area becomes either dim or
normal light (your choice), and creatures sensitive to moonlight or sunlight take penalties
(depending on your wish) when in the area. All your druid spells that deal holy damage do so as if
your Eclipse pool is full. You also gain one Eclipse Point per minute.

<div style="margin-top:250px;"></div>

### Feral
Your magical talents bring you closer to beasts of the wild, making you prime and paragon above
them. Feral druids often take up traits of the beasts they shape to.

#### Fortitude of the Wilds
When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use
Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action or a reaction, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one
spell to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell expended.

#### Fury of the Wilds
Also when gaining this archetype, when determining your maximum allowable
CR to transform to, you divide your level by three, and not eight (round down), referring to the
below table.

| Druid Level | Maximum CR |
|:---:|:---:|
| 2 | 1/2
| 4 | 1
| 6 | 2
| 9 | 3
| 12 | 4
| 15 | 5
| 18 | 6

#### Primal Strike
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of
overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. You also gain a +1 bonus
to your attack and damage rolls.

#### Blessed Beast
Starting at 10th level, you may gain a special ability when in wild shape. Choose any
of category of wild shape (land, sea, air, or plant), and you may assign one of the following abilities
to all creatures in that category when wild shaping into them, but only when in that form. Upon
reaching 15th level, you may choose another option.
* Defending beast: Whenever you start your turn while in wild shape, you gain 5 temporary hit points. Furthermore,
  you can, as a reaction, gain resistance to one damage type of your choice. This
  remains for one minute, and cannot be used again until you complete a short rest.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:320px;"></div>

* Furious beast: You gain the Berserker Rage talent.
* Holy beast: You gain the priest‘s Channel Divinity as a holy priest, but only to Turn Undead.
  Your effective priest level for this ability is equal to half your druid level. Fiends are also
  turned by this ability, but cannot be destroyed as undead. You cannot increase the number of uses
  of the Channel Divinity effect (regardless of effective priest level).
* Inspiring beast: You gain the bard‘s Inspiration ability. Your effective bard level for this
  ability is equal to half your druid level.
* Magical beast: You may choose any four spells from your druid spell list and cast them in
  while in wild shape. This does not require somatic or verbal components, but you must have
  chosen to merge any material components with you when you chose to wild shape. If taken again,
  this ability adds four other spells.
  Upon gaining the Beast Spells feature of 18th level, you may cast all your druid spells without
  somatic or verbal components, as this ability details. You may choose up four spells per use of this
  ability, and use their material components while wild shaped.
* Prowling beast: Whenever you and an ally both threaten a creature, your ally gains advantage
  to attack rolls against it, and you deal 1d6 extra points of damage to it.
* Persistent beast: Whenever you are in a wild shape, you have advantage to Stamina saving
  throws to maintain a concentration spell. Furthermore, if you lose concentration on a spell by
  taking damage while in wild shape, you regain half the mana spent on the spell. This does not
  count as a normal mana restorative effect.
* Raking beast: You gain the rogue‘s Sneak Attack ability as a 1st level rogue. If chosen again,
  your effective rogue level for this ability is equal to half your druid level.
  Grand Beast. Starting at 14th level, your weapon attacks while in wild shape deal an additional die
  of damage, and your bonus to attack and damage rolls from your Primal Strike feature improves to
  +2.

Also, if you start your turn while under a wild shape, you gain 5 temporary hit points. These do not
stack.

#### Grand Beast
Starting at 14th level, your weapon attacks while in wild shape deal an additional die
of damage, and your bonus to attack and damage rolls from your Primal Strike feature improves to
+2.

Also, if you start your turn while under a wild shape, you gain 5 temporary hit points. These do not
stack.

<div style="margin-top:380px;"></div>

### Restoration
You focus on the renewing and resilient quality of nature. Restoration druids appreciate the more
organic side of nature, preferring to conjure plant allies (usually treants), heal their friends, and
reach out through the Emerald Dream for information and insights to the future.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Restoration Circle Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Pass without trace, rejuvenation |
| 5th | Daylight, lesser restoration |
| 7th | Divination, conjure plants (level 3) |
| 9th | Dream, tranquility |

</div>

#### Healing Lore
When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you may alter the target of a druid sigil spell effect as a bonus action. This requires a successful attack against the new target, and you must be within the range of them to cast the spell normally. The spell’s effects take place at the start of your turn as normal, and you must declare use of this ability at the start of your turn.

#### Extended Growth
Also starting at 2nd level, the duration of healing spells from the druid spell list for you is increased by 1 round (such as the rejuvenation sigil spell).

#### Seed of Power
Starting at 6th level, you may cast a spell on a target and store it on a creature you touch. The spell, if cast this way, does not manifest immediately, and is stored until you discharge it with a mental command. The seed remains active for up to 1 hour.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:400px;"></div>

So long as the seed of power remains active, you gain a general and vague sense of the well-being of the creature and their physical and mental health (such as being rested, excited, pained, etc.), and you may use a reaction at any point to discharge the spell. You do not know the nature of the effect, but can tell that the target has been damaged in a certain way.

If you choose the Lesser Restoration or Greater Restoration spells (or similar effects), the spell can also notify you when the target is affected by a condition the spell would heal or remove (such as death, if casting revivify as a Seed of Power spell).

You may also discharge this spell only if the target is within 5 miles of you, or if both you and the target are in the same terrain, and both have live plants within 30 feet of both of you (such as if being in the same forest or desert).

You can place up to three seeds per day, and a creature can only benefit from one at any given time. This feature has no effect on constructs unless they are plant-based or made of wood.

#### Ironbark
Starting at 10th level, whenever you heal a creature (including yourself), you may imbue
their skin with the resilience of nature. If you do, they gain resistance to all non-magical weapon
damage for 1 minute, or gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level. A given
creature can benefit only once every 24 hours.

#### Wild Growth
Starting at 14th level, whenever you cast a healing sigil from your druid spell list, you can target one additional target, even if the spell specifies only one target. The spell must be three levels below your highest spell level.

Also, a number of times equal to your Spirit modifier (minimum 1), you may use an action to prematurely end a healing sigil spell from the druid spell list. If you choose to do this, the target gains the full benefit as if the spell ended normally.

You regain all uses of this ability when you complete a long rest.

## Hunter (HTR)

*A dwarf watches over frozen mountains, a loyal bear next to him
breathing out warm buffs of breath against the falling snow. The
dwarf studies the tracks in the snow, and then lifts his firearm,
beckoning the bear to continue forward to hunt down the invader to his homeland.*
<br><br>
*Stalking her prey, a troll loads a bolt into her crossbow. The
panther is completely unaware of her, as she prowls through the
jungle. Until it is too late. Before she can react, the bolt pierces
her skull, as the troll walks calmly to claim her prize.*
<br><br>
*As a ship enters the harbor, a thin whistle of a crossbow bolt whispers in the wind. The navigator
silently collapses, dragging the ship‘s wheel with her as she falls, forcing the ship to veer off and
collide with the dock‘s wooden beams, before its hull is punctured by the harbor‘s rocky bottom,
sinking. A goblin disappears back into the forest from his perch, his job complete, sporting a quiet
smile on his face.*
<br><br>
From an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into
the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. Masters of their
environment, they are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their
enemies.

### Deadly Rangers
Warriors of the wilderness, hunters specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of
civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and even
dragons. They learn to track their prey as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and
hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:510px;"></div>

Hunters focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific
favored foes. Thanks to their intimate familiarity with the wilds, hunters also acquire the ability to
cast spells that harness nature‘s power, much like a druid. Their spells, like their combat abilities,
focus on speed, stealth, and the hunt.

### Independant Adventurers
Hunters are stalkers in the wild, living on their knowledge of survival and skill with a bow or rifle.
They are deeply in tune with nature and some of its mightiest beasts are their allies. Of Azeroth's
many creatures, few can resist the hunters' call, and fewer can survive their fury. Hunters are as
varied as the world's many climates, but they are universally renowned for their amazing abilities to
find their prey and bring it down. They come from any race, though certain races naturally excel at
the hunter's profession. Most hunters seek to aid the balance of nature along with their druidic
allies.

Hunters are skilled in stealth, slipping through the woods like a ghost. Orcs of the Horde first
learned the ways of the Azerothian hunter from forest trolls on Lordaeron and tauren have been
masters of the hunt since the dawn of the world. Like the druid, hunters call upon the spirits of the
land, wind, and fire to aid them in their hunts and tasks.

### Creating a Hunter
As you create your hunter character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your
particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you
mastered the hunter‘s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain— perhaps
by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills
as part of a band of hunter‘s

\pagebreakNum

affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as
wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a
magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

What‘s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone
you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters
cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a
continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you
join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the
wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

#### Quick Build
You can make a hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Agility your highest
ability score, followed by Spirit. (Some hunters who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength
higher than Agility.) Second, choose the outlander background.

### Class Features
As a hunter, you have the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per hunter level

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None

___
- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Agility
- **Skills:** Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception,

\pagebreakNum

#### Favored Enemy
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. You gain the Favored Enemy talent. At 6th and 14th level, you gain it again.

#### Hunter Talent
Starting at 1st level, you gain a class talent, representing your preferred tactics and abilities you
honed through your experience of hunting. See Class Talents at the end of the Chapter 3 for
options.

Whenever you qualify for another talent (as detailed in the talent column), you can choose another
talent or gain another use of an existing talent.

#### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following
options. You can‘t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose
again.
* **Archery** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
* **Defense** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
  damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Hunter Focus
You may choose to gain the ability to cast spells (drawing from the divine essence of nature itself) or to gain proficiency in engineering. Choose either the Spellcasting or Engineering features.

#### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A hunter can conjure and bind beasts, elementals, fey, and plants. Beast master hunters often
choose their animal companions from previously bounded animals.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each hunter level provides you with 0.5 caster levels in the hunter class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of hunter spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the hunter
spell list.

When you do so, you may ready a number of hunter spells equal to half the number you can
prepare normally (a 3rd level hunter with +2 Spirit can prepare 2 spells instead of 5).

When you level up, you can exchange the spells known with others you qualify for. You cannot
otherwise change your hunter spells other than by leveling up and exchanging them, or by training
under another hunter, druid, or fey creature (see tutorship under magic), who can change your
prepared spells after training is completed.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Spirit is your spellcasting ability for your hunter spells, since your magic draws upon your
attunement to nature. You use your Spirit whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Spirit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier

##### Spellbook – Idol
At 2nd level, your idol contains three 1st-level hunter spells of your choice. When you level up, you
gain 2 additional hunter spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research,
tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your idol is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by meditating with it and inhaling
herbal vapors.

##### Shot Spells
Shot spells may be cast while attacking with a ranged weapon, and counts as a strike feat for most
purposes except where otherwise noted.

Some hunters eschew the arts of nature magic, and instead focus entirely on technology.
They can lose access to all spells, and instead gain the Sharpshooter feature instead of the
Spellcasting Feature.

#### Sharpshooter
You gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools and weapons created by the tools (such as firearms and
explosives). You also create and maintain such weapons with a 25% reduction to cost.

If you already have proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools, you instead gain expertise to all checks with
these tools (although this does not improve the strength of technologically-crafted items).
You also gain one of the following features of your choice:
* The Suffused Arrows talent.
* The Flash Bomber talent

#### Hunter Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Beast Master who bonds with
an animal, a Marksman who always finds their target and excels in bringing them down, and a
Survivalist, who has several terrain-based abilities and is an expert ambusher, all of which are
detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at
7th, 11th, and 15th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn.

\pagebreakNum

#### Hide in Plain Sight
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have
access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create
your camouflage. Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up
against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a
+10 bonus to Agility (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions.

Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again with an action
so long as she remains in the same general terrain type. If you are in a different terrain, you must
spend another minute.

#### Foe Slayer
Starting at 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your
turns, you can add your Spirit modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll. You can choose to use
this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

<div style="margin-top:380px;"></div>

### Beast Master
Your bond with the land is stronger than that of other hunters, a bonded beast appropriate to your
terrain has chosen to fight alongside you. Beast master hunters are the most common adventuring
hunters to fight without aid.

#### Hunter’s Companion
At 3rd level, you gain a bound companion that accompanies you on your
adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. This acts as a normal bound companion. The
companion must be a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or
lower (for example, a hawk, mastiff, or panther). See Bound Companion for more details. The
hunter is able to cast the bind spell to bind beasts, even if the spell is not prepared or spellcasting
was removed due to the Sharpshooter ability.

##### Bond
Due to your bond with the beast, you can add your proficiency bonus to the beast‘s AC, attack
rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. The beast also
gains proficiency in two skills of your choice, and to all saving throws. Due to your bond, however,
the companion loses the Multiattack feature (if it possesses it). This does not stack with their own
proficiency bonuses.

Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your hunter level, whichever is
higher.

Whenever you gain Extra Attack, you can give the extra attack action to your beast instead of using
it yourself. This decision is made on the start of your turn on every round.

##### Leveling up
Your beast companion improves in CR the higher your level becomes, CR equal to 1 per every 8
levels of Hunter (improving to 1 CR at level 4, 2 CR at level 8, and 3 CR at level 16). This either
takes the form of choosing a higher-level companion, or adding hit dice to the companion until its
CR increases.

When reaching 8th level, you can choose a Large creature. The companion also gains an Ability
Score Improvement once you do (this acts as the normal feature).

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:380px;"></div>

##### Special
While traveling through your favored terrain with your beast, you can move stealthily at a normal
pace. Bonding with a beast requires spending one hour communicating with the creature by
nonverbal cues, and spending the next seven hours in bonding activities (hunting, etc.).

#### Spirit Bond.
Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns, you can use a bonus action to command
the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on your turn. The beast also has
advantage with any saving throw to resist spells that control or repel it (such as charm or fear
spells), if the spell would cause it to abandon or betray you.

You may also empower the spirit link to your beast. Doing so takes 1 minute of physical contact
with a magic weapon (such as placing a magic sword against its paw, tapping it with a magic staff, or
resting a magic bow on it). Once the task is completed, the beast‘s weapon attacks are treated as
magical as well for 1 hour. You may use weapons that belong to others, but not if they are attuned
to others. If the weapon is attuned to you, it takes only 1 round of physical contact.

#### Frenzy
Starting at 11th level, you can command your companion to attack with a bonus action,
allowing it to make two attacks when it uses an action to attack on its turn. This stacks with giving
your animal companion an extra attack from your Extra Attack feature.

Your animal companion‘s weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 and 20.

#### Empowered Bond
Beginning at 15th level, you and your animal companion may share the
damage both of you take by dividing it by two so long as you are within 30 feet of one another, as if
under the effects of the spirit link spell.

As long as you and your animal companion are within one mile or less of one another, you may
also use an action to see through your companion‘s eyes and sense through their normal senses,
though you are blind to your own surroundings if you do so.

### Marksman
You are a master archer or sharpshooter who excels in bringing down enemies from afar.
Marksmen hunters are often favored allies in battle, as chosen shot spells and the ability to focus
their fire on an enemy can turn the tide of battle.

#### Careful Aim
Once you gain this archetype at 3rd level, you may use a bonus action as part of
shooting to grant yourself advantage your ranged weapon attack. You cannot use this if you already
moved in the previous round.

If you use a [Shot] effect or reload a firearm you are using, you can also benefit from advantage to
your ranged weapon attack.

#### Hawk Eye
Starting at 7th level, you double your range with all ranged weapon attacks. Also, your
first ranged attack in a given round is a critical hit if the target is surprised.

#### Multi-Shot Strike
Starting at 11th level, whenever you successfully strike an enemy with a ranged
attack, you may use a bonus action to attack any other target within 5 feet of the original target.

You may also instead designate a 10-foot-square within the range of your ranged weapon, and
bombard any number of enemies the area, dealing your normal weapon damage, plus the
minimum possible damage roll from each extra attack you have (taking the lowest result on the
weapon damage roll).

#### Chimera Shot [Shot]
Beginning at 15th level, you gain the ability to use Chimera Shot once per
Spirit modifier, regained at the end of a long rest. You may declare the use of Chimera Shot, which
allows you to combine the effects of up to three different shot spells in the same attack. This does
not cost mana.

If you do not have access to shot spells, you can use the properties of up to three different
ammunition types (such as suffused arrows or other special ammunition).

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/j0RJ7pI.png' style='position:absolute; bottom:0px; left:-50px; width:100%; height:100%;' />

### Survival
You are a rugged tracker who uses animal venom, explosives, and traps as deadly weapons. Survival
hunters usually walk alone, but make excellent advanced scouts and explorers who can handle
nearly any terrain.

#### Survival Knowledge
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools (though only to
make traps and explosives) and the Poisoner‘s Kit.

You also gain +10 feet to your speed when wearing medium armor or less, and when not using a
shield.

#### Trap Expert
Starting at 7th level, any creature subjected to traps set by you have disadvantage to
their saves, or the trap has advantage to any attack against them, and you may add your Proficiency
bonus to all saving throw DCs or attack rolls made by traps you set or poisons you create.

The trap needs only to be set by you, and not necessarily built by you. You may also add one
additional explosive to any trap you set without triggering it (such as adding two mines, or one
mine and a wagon clamp).

#### Poison Science
Starting at 11th level, you can harvest triple the normal quantity of poisons from
dead creatures. You also gain resistance to all poison damage. Gaining acquired immunity to
poisons or diseases requires only one-quarter the normal time.

#### Grit
Starting at 15th level, you only lose a death saving throw on a dice result of a natural 1
(counts as one failure) or when being attacked while dying.

You may also apply poisons on your weapon as a bonus action.

Furthermore, you always count yourself as within your favored terrain for the purposes of travel (so
long as you have the favored terrain talent), and whenever one of your traps harm a creature, you
always treat it as if it is surprised against you, unless combat hasn‘t already started.

## Mage (MGE)
*Standing atop a ruined cliff-side chapel, a human
mage retreats against the demonic infernal. Climbing
up the side, the infernal barely has time to react, as
the human raises his arms, unleashing a volley of
fireballs at the infernal, before releasing a storm of ice
upon the demon, sending it spiraling into the chasm
below.*
<br><br>
*Surveying the battlefield from afar, a blood elf looks
to the skies, finishing the last words of the spell. The
clouds part as an ice crystals form, before falling to the
ground, crashing and wreaking bloody havoc amongst
her adversaries. Allowing the faintest smile, she walks
away from the carnage, her duty fulfilled.*
<br><br>
*The draenei mage-lord clad in violet and gold robes stands firm before fel winds. As a doomguard
elite breaks his flank, he turns to it, sweeping his hand at its direction, suffusing the fiend with
planar magic. The wills of the two clash, and then the doomguard roars in frustration, as he is
banished from the battlefield to whence he came. Satisfied, the draenei sweeps his staff over the
remaining demons. As the violet crystal sweeps over them, time slows, and they are torn apart by
swords loyal to the Army of Light.*
<br><br>
Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the Mage. The
arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most
devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, magi wear only cloth armor, but
arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, magi
can summon bursts of fire or storms of ice to decimate distant

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:520px;"></div>

targets and cause entire regiments to
erupt with elemental energy, or to barrage them with violet blasts of pure arcane magic.

### Scholars of the Arcane
The wizards of Azeroth are commonly known as mages, or magi. The magi of Azeroth acknowledge
the corrupting influence of arcane magic, and unlike Warlocks, they temper their advancement
with cool intellect and precision.

Mages focus on magic that creates and changes things, most often with the purpose of damaging
their enemies and boosting the power of their allies. Such beings can obtain a familiar, which is a
normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a
mage.

Magi also understand the workings of arcane energy so well they can counter most magic with great
effectiveness. Those who have dedication to and natural predilection for one of the schools of
specialization or a magic tradition becomes more entrenched.

The magi of the Kirin Tor first mastered the art of casting spells using the elements of ice and fire.

Magi are also known for being able to summon elementals, usually water elementals, but can also
summon air, earth, and fire elementals. The greatest mortal mage ever to have lived might be the
naga Queen Azshara (who may no longer be mortal) or the legendary human Medivh, the last
Guardian of Tirisfal, who set in motion many events in the Third War.

\pagebreakNum

The first known magi on Azeroth were elves. They existed before the breaking of the Well of
Eternity and the Exile of the High Elves, who lived on the shores of the Well of Eternity and
wielded its tremendous magic powers. When the elven kingdom made their ancient pact to aid the
human kingdom of Arathi, the magi learned arcane magic as well, turning the tide of the Troll
Wars to cement the human and elven presence in Azeroth.

### The Lure of Knowledge
Mages‘ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a mage is likely to come to an ordinary life is working
as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other
mages sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous mages out of the safety of
their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Mages believe that their
counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and
discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the
present age.

### Creating a Mage
Creating a Mage character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event.

How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an
aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly?
Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you
hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by
any other mage? Perhaps you‘re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the
face of danger.

#### Quick Build
You can make a mage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your
highest ability score, followed by Stamina or Agility.

Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the mage hand, light, and frost bolt cantrips,
along with the following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning hands, charm (humanoid), feather
fall, mana shield, arcane missile, and sleep.

### Class Features
As a mage, you have the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per mage level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Stamina modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Stamina modifier per mage level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** None
- **Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows
- **Tools:** None
___
- **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Spirit
- **Skills:**  Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a quarterstaff or *(b)* a dagger
- *(a)* a component pouch or *(b)* an arcane focus
- *(a)* a scholar‘s pack or *(b)* an explorer‘s pack
- A spellbook

#### Invocation
Starting at 1st level, you may rapidly recover your mana by invoking attuning yourself to the flows of magic. You can use your action and bonus action on your turn to regain up to 20 mana points.

You replenish your reserve of the flows when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, arcane energies suffuse you, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting you advantage to saving throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

##### Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first
glimmerings of your true power.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A mage can conjure and bind aberrations, celestials, constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, oozes, and
undead, as well homunculi creatures (creatures with the homunculus template).

##### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level mage spells of your choice. When you
level up, you gain 2 additional mage spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by
research, tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each mage level provides you with 1 caster level in the mage class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the mage spell
list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells by consulting your spellbook after a long rest.

Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute per spell level for
each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your mage spells, since you learn your mage spells
through dedicated study and memorization.

You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Intelligence modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Intelligence modifier

##### Ritual Casting
You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your
spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

\columnbreak

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your mage spells.

##### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook. You do not
gain spells by default, and typically scribe spells from scrolls into your own spellbook, or purchase
(or steal) the spellbooks of others, or research them yourself.

#### Mage Tradition
When you reach 2nd level, you choose a mage tradition, shaping your practice of magic through
one of eight schools, or through the disciplines of Arcane, Fire, or Frost, detailed at the end of the
class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th
level.

The most common traditions in Azeroth are the three below: Arcane, Fire, and Frost. Arcane and
Frost are preferred by the students and people of Dalaran, but the grand power of Fire is nothing to
be ignored. Other than the above specializations, the Necromancy and Conjuration schools (as
described in the core rulebook) are common in Azeroth.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will with
no mana cost. Choose a 2nd-level and one 3rd-level mage spell that are in your spellbook.

You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending mana when you have them
prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level (or if the spell consumes mana in its
description), you must expend mana as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different
spells of the same levels.

#### Signature Spell
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little
effort. Choose two 4th-level mage spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have
these spells prepared, they don‘t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can
cast each of them once at 4th level without expending mana. When you do so, you can‘t do so
again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend mana as normal.

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

### Arcane
You manipulate focused mysterious arcane and raw mana powers more adeptly than others,
destroying enemies with overwhelming raw magic force. Arcane mages adopt a more scholarly
persona than other mages.

#### Arcane Spheres
Starting at 2nd level, you gain one Arcane Sphere whenever one of the following
happens to you:
* You deal arcane damage to an enemy with a mage ability or spell from the mage list
* You lose at least 8 mana points by being target of the mana burn or detonate mana spells or absorbing damage via the mana shield spell. If absorbing damage by the mana shield spell, you gain one Arcane Sphere for each 8 mana points lost this way.
* You suffer an attack from another Mystic Blast or similar ability (usually called Mystic, Fire,
  Arcane, or Shadow Blasts), unless it is fel damage (in which case you do not gain a sphee).
___
This applies once per spell. Arcane Spheres may be used to empower your abilities. Arcane Spheres
may be spent for the following:
* *Augmenting Arcana.* Deal 1 additional point of arcane damage per damage dice with mage
  spells and abilities that deal arcane damage. This can be spent after rolling for damage, and
  applies once per spell. This does not stack with similar abilities.
* *Mana Circulation.* You may substitute 1 Arcane Sphere for 2 mana points (cannot reduce mana point loss beyond 1) for effects that consume mana (such as spells or mana burn and similar effects).
___
You may have a maximum number of spheres equal to 2 plus your Proficiency bonus, and they
remain for one hour after being acquired.

#### Arcane Power Mastery
Also starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to unleash blasts of arcane
force as an action. You gain the Mystic Blast feat. Unlike the normal Mystic Blast feat, this only
deals arcane damage.

You also always have the mana shield spell prepared, and whenever you cast the spell, you gain
temporary hit points equal to your Arcane Blast damage until the spell ends.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:320px;"></div>

#### Presence of Mind
Starting at 6th level, you may store bits of your mental focus and concentration
over the day, and then discharge the stored potential to cast a spell. When you cast a mage spell
that has a casting time of 1 action, it instead becomes a bonus action. You can cast two spells in
one round this way, and are not restricted to cantrips. For this purpose, Mystic Blast counts as a
spell.

Once this ability is used a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, it cannot be used
again until after a long or short rest.

#### Arcane Power
Starting at 10th level, you can open yourself to latent arcane energies with an action, channeling power you would normally be unable to channel. For the next minute, every mage spell you cast costs 2 less mana points (minimum 1 mana). If the spell is heightened from a lower spell level, it costs 4 less points instead. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until after a short or long rest, or unless you spend 4 Arcane spheres.

#### Focus Power
Starting at 14th level, you can choose to re-use arcane energies that normally
dissipate into the ether when casting spells. Whenever you affect a target by a mage spell on your
turn, you can also make an Arcane Blast attack without spending an action. This can be used once
per turn, regardless of how many targets you affect by your spell, and can only be added to spells
two levels lower than your highest-level spell.

If the spell has a duration more than instantaneous, you can instead choose to deliver the damage
at any point of the duration instead of after instantaneously striking the target (up to a maximum
of the end of the spell‘s duration).

The damage of the Arcane Blast is added to the total damage despite being of a different type (and
is counted as one attack; thus, if the original spell had a saving throw to negate or half damage, the
extra damage is negated or halved appropriately).

### Fire
You ignite enemies with bolts of flame and exploding fire, heating up until you deliver the final
strike. Fire mages are well-appreciated engines of destruction in war.

#### Controlled Destruction
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the
effects of your fire evocation spells. When you cast a fire evocation spell that affects other creatures
that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + your intelligence modifier. The
chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no
damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

Also, for a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, your fire evocation spells can be used
to set a target single on fire, inflicting the burning condition on a failed Stamina saving throw. The
burning damage is equal to 1d6 points of fire damage, or one-quarter the number of dice the spell
dealt (whichever is higher).

You may use multiple uses on a single spell. You regain all spent uses at the end of a short rest.

#### Student of Flame
Also beginning at 2nd level, you may scribe evocation spells with other energy
types as fire spells in your spellbook. The spells act the same way, unless the DM rules it is
unreasonable (such as a slippery effect on a fire sleet spell). You also gain resistance to fire damage.

Scorch. Starting at 6th level, you may cast fire bolt as a bonus action. Also, you may critically hit
with any ranged fire spell attack on a 19 and a 20, dealing double damage. Also, whenever a
creature suffers the burning condition from your fire spells, they also have disadvantage to ability
checks so long as the condition remains.

#### Black Fire
Starting at 10th level, you may spend a bonus action and curse a creature within 30 feet
with black flame, reducing its resistance to fire damage. The creature must succeed on a Stamina
saving throw or fall to the hex for 1 minute. If it is immune to fire damage, it becomes resistant
instead. If resistant, it takes fire damage normally.

If it doesn't have immunity nor resistance, you (and only you) instead deal bonus fire damage to
them equal to half your level. This applies once per spell or effect.

A creature cannot be subjected to this effect more than once for 24 hours. You can only affect one
creature with this ability at any given time.

#### Pyromaniac
At 14th level, you add the pyroblast spell to your spellbook if it isn‘t already within it.

Whenever you critically hit with a ranged fire spell, you may spend a bonus action to gain one
round of concentration on the pyroblast spell for each critical hit. The pyromaniac bonus remains
for one hour or until you cast the spell, and stacks with itself. It cannot exceed the maximum
damage you can deal with spell, however. For this purpose, you count as if you critically hit if one
of the targets of your fire spells fails by a natural 1-2 on a saving throw, or if you score a natural 19-
20 on a ranged attack with a fire spell.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/j0RJ7pI.png' style='position:absolute; bottom:0px; left:-50px; width:100%; height:100%;' />

### Frost
You debilitate and freeze your enemies in their tracks, before shattering them with ice magic or
entombing them in it for eternity. Frost mages are usually explorers, as their ability to debilitate,
slow, and evade foes gives them survivability that makes them natural to the task.

#### Chilling Effects
Starting at 2nd level, you may use a bonus action to inflict the chilled condition to
any target of your cold spells for one round. The condition stacks as normal, even with spells that
already chill the enemy. If multiple creatures are chilled, choose a number equal to your
Intelligence modifier.

#### Student of Frost
Also beginning at 2nd level, you may scribe evocation spells with other energy
types as cold spells in your spellbook. The spells act the same way, unless the DM rules it is
unreasonable (such as a burning effect on a cold spell). You also gain resistance to cold damage.

#### Ice Lance
Starting at 6th level, you know the frost bolt cantrip, and can always cast it as a bonus
action. You can also use this cantrip if you already cast a spell in the same round.

Also, you can create a path of frost over water (or any liquid that freezes at a similar temperature)
with any spell that deals cold damage (including cantrips). This freezes a number of consecutive 5-
foot squares equal to double the spell level (or a single square if a cantrip).

The frozen path melts away in one minute (or may not if the weather is at below freezing). The path
can also be broken by spending 5 feet of movement for every 5-foot square.

#### White Ice
Starting at 10th level, you may spend a bonus action and curse a creature within 30 feet
with white ice, reducing its resistance to cold damage. The creature must succeed on a Stamina
saving throw or fall to the hex for 1 minute.

If it is immune to cold damage, it becomes resistant instead. If resistant, it takes cold damage
normally. If it doesn't have immunity nor resistance, you (and only you) instead deal bonus cold
damage to them equal to half your level. This applies once per spell or effect.

A creature cannot be subjected to this effect more than once for 24 hours. You can only affect one
creature with this ability at any given time.

#### Ice Statues
At 14th level, whenever a target of your mage spells becomes restrained by having their speed reduced to 0 by the chilled condition, they are also incapacitated for the duration of the chilled condition. Against such targets, your frost bolt cantrip is automatically a critical hit if it successfully hits, but the chilled condition ends prematurely (and is not applied for frost bolt).

Also, whenever you deal damage to a creature that exceeds one-half their maximum hit points at
once, they are both restrained and incapacitated for one hour (or until they thaw out, whichever
comes first). Both effects end prematurely if the target is hit.

<div style="margin-top:410px;"></div>

## Monk (MNK)

*Witnessing an orc and a human locked in battle on his
land, a pandaren intervenes. Expertly placing his staff
between the two combatants and intercepting, he parries
every one of their blows, using their own attacks against
them. Without landing a single attack on his adversaries, he
emerges triumphant.*
<br><br>
*An ancient temple lays atop the snowy peak of a mountain,
the violent winds cut away at the pandaren‘s face as she
meditates. She can feel the balance of the world, the good
and bad, the calm and the rage, the silence and the storm.
The mists slowly curl around her paws, filling her shivering
body with warmth, soothing her aching muscles and lifting
her broken spirit.*
<br><br>
*The wildhammer dwarf gathers power into himself, tattoos on his back shimmering. He then
releases a single powerful blow that shatters a stone larger than he. He then turns to the three orcs
hiding in the bushes, and smirks as they flee, leaving their weapons behind.*
<br><br>
When the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the monks that brought
hope to a seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these
pandaren instead focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the
opportunity for revolution struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression.
Dwarves and tauren are also familiar with the way of the monk, although they know it as runeweaving.

### Masters of the Mind
Experts of bare-handed combat, monks never rely solely on the need to have a weapon in their
hands to defend against their enemies. Although most widely known to the outside world for their
fearsome jabs and flying kicks, they refuse to limit themselves to a single method of combat.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:430px;"></div>

Many monks prefer instead to ―soak it up‖ and seem to revel in the intoxicating effect of absorbing
blow after blow while their companions press the attack. Other monks specialize in calling upon
the restorative power of the mists to balance the good and bad energy within people, returning
them to good health and fortune. Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most
monastic traditions call chi.

This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that
flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects
and exceed their bodies‘ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow
of chi in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their
unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of chi gives them
more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

### Discipline and Harmony
Monks bring a unique martial arts style to any fight, and harness an exotic form of magical energy
that‘s unfamiliar to those who practice other arcane arts. They seek spiritual balance in life and in
combat, and as dangerous as monks can be on the battlefield, they‘re rarely looking to pick a fight
without just cause.

They view the world through a different lens, finding power through serenity and inner peace—then
expressing it through artful combat techniques and powers that mend life. Perhaps most
surprisingly, Monks are also adept at producing powerful brews they consume to aid them in battle.

Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that
might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies
or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.

\pagebreakNum

### Creating a Monk
The Monks of Azeroth usually follow Pandaren monastery tradition, ever since they were
subjugated by the mogu. They usually act independently from factions, seeing the ebb and flow of
right and wrong to belong with neither sides, and can be found in the most unusual of places,
seeking wisdom or enlightenment.

As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you
learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the
monastery‘s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service
performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or
did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important
mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the
community‘s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to
accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home? If you are a dwarf or
tauren, do you follow the old ways of rune-weaving? Why have you chosen this path over others,
and how do you compare your ancient traditions with the more structured beliefs of the pandaren
monks?

As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness
chi, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

\pagebreakNum

#### Martial Arts
At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes
and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don‘t have the twohanded or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you
aren‘t wearing armor or wielding a shield:
* You can use Agility instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed
  strikes and monk weapons.
* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.
  This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial column of the Monk table. If you
  have a greater damage die, you may choose that instead.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn,
  you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and
  attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you
  haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a
nunchaku (club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain) or a kama (sickle with a
shorter, straighter blade), or even a large tankard of alcohol (club). Whatever name you use for a
monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

#### Ki
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki (or Chi within
Pandaren circles). Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. You have a
number of Ki points equal to your monk level.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry
of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in
this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of
which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself.

You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki
features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature‘s effects.
The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
<br><br>
**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier.

##### Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two
unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

##### Patient Defense
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

##### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and
your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

\columnbreak

##### Casting Ki Spells
Some monk abilities allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and
other rules, but you don‘t need to provide material components for it. You can spend additional ki
points to the original value to increase the level of the spell that you cast, provided that the spell
has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for
each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level Brewmaster and use Breath
of Fire to cast burning hands, you can spend 2 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell or 3 ki and cast
it as a 3rd level spell. The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way
(including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is
determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table. Your effective
spellcasting ability score is Spirit.

#### Monk Talent
Starting at 2nd level, you gain a class talent, representing your various special abilities, either by use
of Ki, natural grace in movement, or esoteric fighting techniques. See Class Talents at the end of
the Chapter 3 for options.

Whenever you qualify for another talent (as detailed in the talent column), you can choose another
talent or gain another use of an existing talent.

#### Monk Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monk tradition: the way of the Brewmaster,
who excels in mysterious drinks, the way of the Mistweaver, who heals themselves and others, or
the way of the Windwalker, the adventurous and evasive combatant.

All traditions are detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at
3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

As normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn.

#### Stunning Strike
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent‘s body. When you hit
another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning
strike. The target must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next
turn. Despite the name, this is not a strike effect.

#### Ki-Empowered Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming
resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

#### Stillness of Mind
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be
charmed or frightened.

\pagebreakNum

#### Purity of Body
At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and
poison.

Furthermore, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and
take the second result.

#### Tongue of the Sun and Moon
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken
languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

#### Timeless Body
At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be
aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

#### Empty Body
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1
minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but arcane damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material
components. When you do so, you can‘t take any other creatures with you.

#### Perfect Self
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

<div style="margin-top:290px;"></div>

### Brewmaster
You are focused on evading blows and empowering themselves and your allies through your brews.
Brewmasters make the most common of monk adventurers.

#### Brewmaster Focus
Upon reaching 3rd level and gaining this monk tradition, you may add the
following Ki power to your repertoire.

##### Breath of Fire
As an action, you can spend 1 Ki to cast the burning hands spell. This requires only verbal components. You can spend additional Ki to heighten the spell (up to the normal limit of ki spells).

#### Drunken Style Stance [Stance]
Also starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to enter the
drunken style stance. So long as you are in this stance, use of the Step of the Wind Ki ability does
not spend Ki. Furthermore, due to your consistent drunken interventions, a target successfully
struck by one of your melee weapon attacks has have disadvantage to attack rolls to attacks that do
not target you, and reduces its spell DCs and spell attack bonus by 4 points if the spell does not
include you.

This stance is broken if you move more than your normal speed in a single round.

#### Brewmaster Ki
Upon reaching 6th level, you gain the following new Ki powers and add them to
your repertoire.

##### Purifying Touch [Strike]
As an action, you can spend 3 Ki and cast the dispel magic spell.

This requires touching the effect or creature that is subject to the effect. You may use this as a touch or as a strike effect. You can spend additional Ki to heighten the spell (up to the normal limit of ki spells). If you end a spell this way, you regain a number of Ki points equal to the dispelled spell’s level (if dispelling multiple spells, choose only the highest-level spell). This cannot restore more Ki than double the amount spent on the ability.

##### Brewmaster’s Stagger
As a reaction, you may spend 2 Ki and stagger damage done to you,
spreading the damage over multiple rounds. You suffer one-quarter the damage you would

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

normally suffer. At the start of your turn in the next round, you suffer another one-quarter. This
continues at the start of your turn every round until you spread the damage over a total of four
rounds (suffering one-quarter every round). If you would stagger damage when at 0 hit points, you
automatically fail your death saving throw. You cannot stagger damage unless you are benefitting
from Unarmored Defense.

Whenever you choose to stagger damage while in Drunken Style Stance, you may direct any excess
healing you would benefit to the pool of staggered damage.

#### Brewmaster’s Sturdiness
Also starting at 6th level, you can use your weight to enhance your blows
and deflect attacks.

Your AC increases by one-half your Strength modifier, and you may add 3 points of damage to all
your melee attacks that are modified by Strength so long as you are above half your carrying
capacity. You must benefit from Unarmored Defense to make use of this ability.

#### Ox Stance [Stance]
Starting at 11th level, you may enter this stance as a bonus action by spending
2 Ki. While in this stance, you may add your Spirit modifier to all saving throws, and you are
enhanced with greater resilience. You may stagger damage twice for no cost, and whenever you
choose to stagger damage while in this stance, you suffer one less round of damage (suffering a total
of three-quarters damage). Furthermore, you do not automatically fail death saving throws from
triggered by staggered damage.

Also, the first time you enter this stance, you gain temporary hit points equal to double your level.

If you succeed on an Agility or Strength saving throw against an effect and take no damage, you
may enter this stance for only 1 Ki point, as a reaction.

This stance is also broken if you move more than your normal speed in a single round.

#### Zen Pose
Starting at 17th level, your Ox Stance is enhanced into Zen Pose. So long as you do not
take damage from an attack and do not fail a saving throw, your enemies have disadvantage to
attack rolls against you, and you have advantage to all saving throws. Whenever both rolls (from
advantage or disadvantage) are resolved to your benefit while in the pose (such as an attack failing
once normally and again due to disadvantage), you regain 1 Ki point.

<div style="margin-top:250px;"></div>

### Mistweaver
You are focused on empowering and supporting allies. Mistweavers are usually the most elusive of
the monk disciplines.

#### Mistweaver Focus
Upon reaching 3rd level and gaining this monk tradition, you may add the
following Ki power to your repertoire.

##### Soothing Mist
As an action, you may expend Ki and gain a cloud of healing mists. The
creature gains 2d6 hit points for every Ki point invested. You may target a creature up to 15 feet
away (or a number of creatures within 30 feet of one another), and distribute healing amongst as
many creatures as you wish. If benefitting from Thunder Focus Tea, this ability heals 5 extra hit
points.

If you already used your action to attack a hostile creature and landed at least one successful hit on
your turn in the last round, you may use this ability as a bonus action instead.

You may alternatively expend hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease
or neutralize one poison affecting it, with a number of hit points required equal to one-half the
saving throw DC of the poison (round up). You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple
poisons with a single use of Soothing Mist, expending hit points separately for each one. This
feature has no effect on constructs or undead.

##### Enveloping Mist
As an action, you can spend 1 Ki to cast the rejuvenation or expeditious retreat spells as 1st level spells. These requires only verbal components. You can spend additional Ki to heighten the spells (up to the normal limit of ki spells).

#### Mistweaver’s Enlightenment
Also upon gaining this monk tradition, whenever you deal damage
to a target, you are enhanced with enlightenment for until the end of your turn in the next round.

You may either reduce the Ki cost of an ability you use by 1 point (minimum 1 point), or use the
Soothing Mist Ki power with no expenditure of Ki. This heals as if you spent 1 Ki point only, but
cannot heal a creature above its Bloodied value.

#### Mistweaver Ki
Upon reaching 6th level, you gain the following new Ki powers and add them to
your repertoire.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:250px;"></div>

##### Control Ki
As an action, you may spend 2 Ki to cast the mute spell. Upon reaching 9th level, you may also cast dispel magic as a 3rd level spell. You may either cast them with their normal ranges, use them as strike effects, or imbue them into your brews if you have the Brewer feat. In this case, they are the only imbued effect. You can spend Ki to heighten this effect (up to the normal limit of ki spells).

If the target of your mute spell fails their saving throw or if your dispel magic spell successfully dispels a spell, you regain 1 Ki.

##### Mist Weave
As an action, you can spend 2 Ki to cast the fog cloud and blink step spells as 2nd level spells. You can spend Ki to heighten this effect (up to the normal limit of ki spells). If you use the blink step spell to end adjacent to an ally and target them with your Soothing Mist ability, you regain half the Ki you spend on the ability.

Furthermore, so long as you have at least 2 Ki, you suffer only light obstruction, and never heavy
obstruction from mist and fog.

#### Mistweaver’s Peace
Also starting at 6th level, you can spend 3 Ki to cast the barrier ward spell as a
3rd level spell. Furthermore, if a creature fails to force its way through the barrier or attempts to
deal damage to the barrier, it is pushed 10 feet away from the barrier. If attempting to damage the
barrier, the target is pushed only if they fail a Strength saving throw against your Ki DC.

#### Life Cocoon
Starting at 11th level, you may spend 2 Ki points designate an allied creature with a
cocoon of Ki as an action, which remains for 1 minute. While invigorated this way, the creature
gains 3d10 temporary hit points. So long as the temporary hit points remain, the target heals 50%
more hit points from healing effects.

A creature cannot benefit from life cocoon more than once every 24 hours. You may use this ability
on yourself while stunned or asleep, but not while incapacitated.

#### Enlightenment
Starting at 17th level, you may spend 7 Ki to cast the resurrection spell, or 4 Ki to
cast the revivify spell. Once the resurrection spell is cast, you cannot cast it again until you complete a
short rest, regardless if you have Ki remaining.

Furthermore, your Life Cocoon ability grants 5d10 temporary hit points instead of 3d10, and a
creature can benefit once per a short rest.

<div style="margin-top:340px;"></div>

### Windwalker
You are focused on hand-to-hand combat and evasion of the enemy‘s blows. Windwalkers are
usually the most confrontational of the monk disciplines.

#### Windwalker Focus
Upon reaching 3rd level and gaining this monk tradition, you may add the
following Ki power to your repertoire.

##### Superior Martial Arts
As an action, you may spend 2 Ki and deal a single unarmed attack
roll as an area of effect (expending any number of attacks). You may choose to make it a 5-footburst around you (Hurricane Kick), a 10-foot cone (Fists of Fury), or a 15-foot line (Flying Serpent
Kick). You may move within the specified area of effect without provoking reactions from the
creatures in the area of effect (such as kicking through a line of enemies and landing behind them
with a Flying Serpent Kick, or shifting 5 feet to the right after a Hurricane Kick, or moving 10 feet
to one side after a Fists of Fury). Creatures affected can attempt an Agility saving throw against your
Ki DC to half the damage.

This action counts as if you made a single unarmed attack for the purposes of your Martial Arts
feature and Flurry of Blows ability.

#### Windwalker Grace
Also upon gaining this monk tradition, whenever you deal damage to a target,
you can use your Step of the Wind Ki ability without spending a Ki point.

#### Windwalker Ki
Upon reaching 6th level, you gain the following new Ki powers and add them to
your repertoire.

##### Destroy Mana [Strike]
As an action, you may spend 2 Ki to cast the mana burn spell. This requires touching the effect or creature that is subject to the effect, and does not require vocal components. You can choose to make this ability destroy Ki instead, in which case it removes half the mana points it would normally remove. You may treat this as a strike effect. You can spend Ki to heighten this effect (up to the normal limit of ki spells).

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:350px;"></div>

##### Rising Sun [Strike].
As a bonus action, you may perform an upwards kick, dealing
unarmed damage and imposing an additional effect. You may also choose between dealing extra
2d6 damage, or adding 1d6 to any melee weapon attack you make against the target for the next
minute. If the target succeeds on a Strength saving throw, they take half the 2d6 extra damage, or,
if you chose the second option, ignore the extra damage.

#### Combo Attacks
Starting at 11th level, you score a critical hit with your weapon attacks on a 19-20.

If you already possess this range, the range increases by 1 point to 18-20. When you score a critical
hit, you may either use any one Ki ability with no action or Ki cost (such as flurry of blows, Rising
Sun, your Superior Martial Arts abilities, or Quivering Palm once you gain it), or choose to regain 2
Ki.

#### Quivering Palm
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone‘s body.

When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can use a bonus action and 3 Ki to start these
imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations
are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the
same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Stamina saving throw.

If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 shadow damage instead. You
may place these vibrations even with a harmless touch (which may require a Charisma (Deception)
check contested to a Spirit (Insight) check).

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end
the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

## Paladin (PLD)
*A draenei pores over an ancient libram, moving its pages by his
mere will. Summoning a blessing, he shuts the tome as light
arises from his hooves to the heavens. Hefting his crystalline
greathammer, he exits, aware that his return is unlikely at best.*
<br><br>
*Huddled together, two young orcs cower as a fierce dragon
lands with a resounding crash atop the chieftain‘s hut. She roars
before spewing liquid fire upon the great watchtower, revealing
the orcs in the light. She releases a blast of flame at them—but
then stops. The red inferno dissipates to reveal tauren clad in
golden plate, holding aloft a mighty shield that blocked her fire. Telling the orcs to run, the tauren
prepares himself to face the dragon alone, satisfied he has bought the young orcs the time they
needed to escape.*
<br><br>
*A human rides through haunted plague-lands on a wounded steed. As he nears an abandoned
barn, hisses are from undead throats, as six ghouls skulk from the interior of the barn. The rider
raises a bare hand, causing a burst of holy light to rise from the earth to burn the ghouls. After his
deed is done, the rider continues on, the land still marked with his power, temporarily freed from
unholy blight.*
<br><br>
This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish
evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so
they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds
and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead.

<div style="margin-top:520px;"></div>

### The Cause of Righteousness
Paladins are virtuous defenders of the weak, and tireless, unfaltering enemies of the undead.
Mixing elements of the warrior and the clerics of the Holy Light, the paladin is a tough melee
fighter.

The paladin is a warrior of the Holy Light. They uphold all that is good and true in the world and
revile all that is evil and sinister, especially undead and the Burning Legion. They offer succor to
the beleaguered and smite their enemies with holy fervor. They are particularly potent against
undead, as these creatures threaten the goodly races and the Holy Light burns them terribly. The
presence of any evil is reprehensible to paladins, but they focus their efforts on destroying undead
and demons.

These warriors uphold the tenets of the Holy Light and defend their factions from the predations
of any threat. Found in almost every corner of Azeroth fighting the forces of evil and barbarism,
these stalwart warriors of faith ceaselessly uphold their vigil against demonic forces from beyond the
Dark Portal. Paladins are the embodiment of good and selfless dedication to the protection of their
peoples. They help the innocent and punish the wicked. As such, paladins are generally of good
alignment.

### Bexond the Mundane Life
Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken
him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic
struggle against evil.

\pagebreakNum

Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer
people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn
from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into
the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to
the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country. Adventuring paladins take their work
seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose
than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest
victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.

### Creating a Paladin
The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although
the class features related to your oath don‘t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that
choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class.

Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor
venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the Light, cherishing everything
beautiful that stands against the shadow? Are you a defender who can stand before sea of foes
without flinching? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to deliver retribution on those who have
done great evil?

#### Quick Build
You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your
highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the noble background. Third, choose
the following 1st-level spells for your libram: compelled duel, holy light, and seal array (righteousness).

### Class Features
As a paladin, you have the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per paladin level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Stamina modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Stamina modifier per paladin level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None
___
- **Saving Throws:** Stamina, Charisma
- **Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Deception, and Religion.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a martial weapon and a shield or *(b)* two martial weapons
- *(a)* five javelins or *(b)* any simple melee weapon
- *(a)* a priest‘s pack or *(b)* an explorer‘s pack
- Chain mail, a holy symbol, and a holy libram

\columnbreak

#### Special

##### Seal Spells
Paladins are the only class that can access the seal array spell, and can prepare different seals for
strike effects. Seals are magical enhancements that can enhance a paladin‘s weapon attacks, and can
be released in coordination with the Crusader Strike ability to cause a devastating strike.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings
like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces.

Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60
feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any
being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the lich Kel‘Thuzad, for instance). Within the
same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or
desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your
Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

#### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can cure wounds. As an action, you may lay your hands on a target, investing them with healing energies. For every mana point you spend for Lay on Hands, you heal 1 hit point, up to a maximum amount every action equal to half your maximum hit points. Amounts you heal is instead treated as holy damage for undead and fiends (in which case, this requires a melee spell attack). Excess hit points are lost. When performing Lay on Hands on yourself, this is instead a bonus action.

Alternatively, you can expend the mana to cure one disease or one poison of your choice. Each disease or poison requires spending mana points equal to the saving throw DC of the poison or disease. You may cure multiple diseases or poisons this way. This feature has no effect on constructs. This acts as a lesser restoration spell.

You gain a mana pool as if you were a second level paladin (see the Spellcasting feature below), with the pool size as if you had no access to 1st level spells.

#### Crusader Strike
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend mana as
if you cast a spell to deal holy damage to the target, in addition to the weapon‘s damage. The extra
damage is 1d8 plus 1d8 per spell level (maximum 6d8 with a 5th level spell). If the target is a fiend
or an undead, you gain +5 to the strike‘s damage.

If you have a seal active, you may also perform a Crusader Strike without expending mana (called
Seal Release or Judgment), terminating the effects of the seal (plus an additional effect depending
on the seal). Despite the name, Crusader Strike does not count as a Strike effect.

#### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.
You can‘t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
* **Defense** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
  damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
  wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have
  the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Protection** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use
  your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

#### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast
spells as a priest does.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A paladin can conjure and bind celestials.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each paladin level provides you with 0.5 caster levels in the paladin class (minimum 0). You follow
the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You can also change your list of prepared spells by consulting your libram (treat as a spellbook)
after a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute
per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the
strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a
paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier

##### Spellbook – Libram
At 2nd level, your libram contains three 1st-level paladin spells of your choice. When you level up,
you gain 2 additional paladin spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research,
tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your libram is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by scribing it with new insights
regarding the faith and how to protect and promote it.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your holy libram as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells, as well as the store for
them.

#### Aura
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery over aura spells begins to manifest. You always have the following
aura spells prepared.
* At 3rd level, you always have the devotion aura spell prepared.
* At 6th level, you always have the retribution aura spell prepared.
* At 10th level, you always have the crusader aura spell prepared.
* At 14th level, you always have the concentration aura spell prepared.
* At 18th level, you always have the resistance aura spell prepared.

\pagebreakNum

Furthermore, you may cast each of the above aura spells for no cost once upon reaching the
described level. You regain all expended uses after a short rest.

#### Holy Oath
When you reach 3rd level, you walk a path that defines you as a paladin forever. Up to this time
you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it.

You may choose the Oath of Holiness to aid the helpless, Oath of Protection to guard the weak, or
Oath of Retribution to smite the wicked, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features
include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

##### Oath Spells
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the
oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells
don‘t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn‘t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a
paladin spell for you.

##### Channel Divinity
Your path allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity
option provided by your path explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you
choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this
class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

You may always Turn Undead, and you gain an additional choice from your Path.

##### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using
your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must
make a Spirit saving throw.

If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned
creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can‘t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can‘t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there‘s nowhere to
move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

As normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn.

\columnbreak

#### Divine Health
Starting at 6th level, the divine magics flowing within you grant you immunity to diseases and
advantage against poison, as well as resistance against poison damage.

#### Improved Crusader Strike
By 11th level, you are so suffused with the might of the Light that all your melee weapon strikes
carry its divine power with it. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes
an extra 1d8 holy damage. If you also use your Crusader Strike with an attack, you add this damage
to the extra damage of your Crusader Strike.

#### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing
creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).
You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Aura Improvement
Also starting at 18th level, you have advantage to any check to maintain an aura, and may extend
the range of any aura spell by 100%. Any effect that would normally dispel the aura instead
suppresses it for 1 minute instead.

<div style="margin-top:400px;"></div>

### Oath of Holiness
Your oath is to heal and inspire your allies. Holy paladins are common, and are usually wellregarded battle healers.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Oath of Holiness Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Protection from evil and good, sanctuary |
| 5th | Lesser restoration, zone of truth |
| 9th | Beacon of hope, revivify (or redemption) |
| 13th | Freedom of movement, guardian of faith |
| 17th | Commune, mass revivify (or mass redemption) |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Light of Dawn
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you can spend a Channel
Divinity use and an action, to present your holy symbol and release an outburst of the Holy Light
of Creation, allowing one friendly creature within 30 feet to use a hit dice as if they rested. The ally
also gains temporary hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier.

#### Holy Vision
At 3rd level, whenever you cast a healing spell from the paladin spell list and the dice
shows the maximum possible result (such as a 6 on a d6), you may roll the maximized dice again
and add the amount healed to the total. This applies to healing spells that deal damage to undead.
This does not stack with other similar abilities.

This acts similarly to the Light‘s Insight ability of the holy priesthood. If having both features, and
if the re-rolled dice results in a maximum result as well, you may roll a third time.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:420px;"></div>

#### Holy Auras
At 7th level, your auras increase in strength. You may maintain two aura spells at once
as if they cost one case of concentration. Furthermore, your allies can benefit from two auras at a
time.

Also, whenever an ally is within one of your aura spells, they are more easily healed by you. If you
are using a paladin healing spell, it can heal one additional dice of damage to them. If you are using
the Lay on Hands feature, it can heal 25% extra hit points. If you are using the holy shock spell, it
can heal or deal one additional dice of damage if the target is within one of your aura spells.

#### Latent Prayer
Starting at 15th level, you may cast a healing spell on a creature that only activates
whenever the creature wishes. This does not require concentration on your end, and the creature
(or you) may declare use of the spell as a reaction. This effect remains for one day or until used, and
leaves a holy mark that can be detected as the healing spell. A single creature can only benefit from
one latent prayer until they take a long rest. This may also be applied to undead to harm them (if
possible).

If you use this ability while under the effect of the avatar form paladin spell, you can affect a second
time in the same period.

#### Illuminated Healer
By 20th level, whenever a creature that benefits from a healing effect (such as
Light of Dawn, or healing spell) originating from you manifest a holy shield. This holy shield grants
them temporary hit points equal to the amount they were healed by you.

This shield remains until ten minutes have passed. A creature can benefit from a single holy shield
only once every hour. When you benefit from maximized dice via your Holy Vision feature, you
may roll again (up to twice per instance).

### Oath of Protection
Your oath is to guard your allies and all friends of the Holy Light. Protection paladins are very
tough foes who can survive hefty abuse.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Oath of Protection Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Sanctuary, shield |
| 5th | Lesser restoration, warding bond |
| 9th | Beacon of hope, revivify (or redemption) |
| 13th | Aura of life, death ward |
| 17th | hope of healing, wall of force |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Rook’s Move
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you may spend a Channel
Divinity use to swap places with any ally as a reaction. Choose an ally that is about to be attacked by
a weapon attack, or an ally who took damage from a weapon attack roll. The two of you change
places, ignoring attacks of opportunity provoked as part of movement and difficult terrain. The ally
must be within 30 feet of you, you must have a clear path to them, and the target must be of your
size category or smaller.

If you use this ability before the attack roll is made, but you must declare use of this ability before
knowing whether the attack would hit the ally. The attack roll is made against your normal AC.

If you declare this ability after the attack roll is successful, the attack is automatically successful, and
you switch places, even if you would have otherwise been unharmed (it such as by having a higher
AC value than the attacker‘s attack roll).

#### Avenger’s Shield
Starting 3rd level, you may throw a shield you are wearing as a ranged thrown
attack (even if it is normally strapped to your arm). The shield acts as a light thrown weapon with a
range of 30/60 feet that deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier in damage. The damage dealt is half holy and half

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:330px;"></div>

bludgeoning, and furthermore the target gains the distracted condition for until the
beginning of your turn in the next round. The shield returns instantaneously to your hand, and
may be used again in the same round if you have multiple attacks.

Also, so long as you are using a shield, you cannot lose concentration on an aura spell due to
damage. The Improved Auras ability grants you advantage to any concentration spell from the
Paladin spell list instead.

#### Opportune Prayer
Starting at 7th level, whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you may
cast a healing spell from the paladin spell list as a reaction (so long as the spell has a maximum
casting time of 1 action). You may also do this whenever you score a critical hit, are hit with a
critical hit, or when reduced to 0 hit points.

Furthermore, so long as you have multiple attacks, you can spend them to allow your Avenger‘s
Shield to target multiple creatures. Regardless if the shield hits or misses, it may target another
creature within 30 feet of the first target (up to one target per attack action spent this way). When
you no longer have any extra attacks or choose to stop the bounce, the shield returns to you.

If you are under the effects of the avatar form paladin spell, you can bounce your shield at one extra
target.

#### Holy Sentinel
Starting at 15th level, your Avenger‘s Shield deals 2d4 points of damage instead of
1d4. Also, whenever you successfully strike a target with the shield, you gain a d4 dice (up to a
maximum number of dice equal to 3d4). If you deal Holy damage or heal at least 1 hit point of
damage with your Paladin spells or your Lay on Hands feature, you may expend the dice and add
the result to your roll.

This applies once per spell.

#### Ardent Defender
At level 20, you may, as a reaction, you may gain resistance to all damage for one
round. Once this feature is used a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, it cannot be
used again until you complete a long rest.

When you no longer have uses of this ability, your Opportune Prayer ability allows you to cast any
paladin spell when it is triggered instead (subject to the same casting time restriction).

<div style="margin-top:380px;"></div>

### Oath of Retribution
Your oath is to bring retribution to the wicked, avenging wrongs made but not settled. Retribution
paladins are often wandering knights, hunting down villains and depraved monsters.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Oath of Retribution Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Compelled duel, heroism |
| 5th | Branding smite, warding bond |
| 9th | Daylight, haste |
| 13th | Death ward, guardian of faith |
| 17th | Aligned weapon (or holy weapon), flame strike (or argent cleansing) |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity
Sword of Light. When you take this oath at 3rd level, you can spend a Channel
Divinity use and an action to imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 1
minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (a minimum bonus
of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot-radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If
the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as a bonus action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this
weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. The light is treated as a light spell of your
highest-level paladin level for the purposes of dispelling darkness.

#### Arm of the Law
At 3rd level, you may perform a Crusader Strike as a ranged spell attack. The
attack has a range of 30 feet, and deals only

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:400px;"></div> 
the holy damage as well as any seal release effects.
If you use a thrown weapon, you can use Crusader Strike at a range of up to 30 feet.

Also, whenever you use Crusader Strike or release a seal, you can Dash as a bonus action, but only
to approach the target of your Crusader Strike or an allied creature within 10 feet of the target.

#### Sword of Truth
Starting at 7th level, you add your Charisma modifier to your melee weapon
damage rolls, and whenever you perform a Crusader Strike, you regain hit points equal to half the
holy damage you dealt using the ability.

Lastly, if you are under the effects of the avatar form paladin spell, you can choose one seal you can
cast, and that seal is cast for no mana cost, and remains active until the avatar form spell ends.

#### Divine Storm
Starting at 15th level, whenever you use a Crusader Strike, you may allow the holy
energies to radiate from you in a blazing storm of holy radiance. All hostile creatures within 5 feet
of you suffer the same holy damage dealt by the Crusader Strike ability. They may halve the damage
on a successful Spirit saving throw against your Spell save DC.

If you released a seal, the release effect is applied only to the initial creature. You also only regain
hit points appropriate to the damage you dealt the initial target.

If you are under the effects of the avatar form paladin spell, you may reroll any 1 or 2 on a damage
dice for your Crusader Strike, and you must choose the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

#### Emancipate
At level 20, your Cleansing Touch ability may be used at a range of 10 feet, and you
may always cast it on yourself, even when otherwise incapacitated.
Furthermore, whenever you have no mana points remaining or uses of Cleaning Touch, you may
spend hit dice to fuel your Crusader Strike feature (up to one hit dice per spell level).

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

## Priest (PRS)
*A human screams in agony as blood gushes from the wound in his chest. A night elf comes to his
aid, whispering a prayer to Elune, before nocking an arrow to her bow. Moonlight breaks through
the tree canopy above, as the gash in the human‘s chest heals closes.*
<br><br>
*As an orc receives arrow after arrow to the chest, he falls to the ground, motionless. Before long, a
yellow-white light shines upon him, and climbs to his feet, revealing a blood elf behind, raising her
staff high, bathed in a similar light.*
<br><br>
*Testing the boundaries of his sanity, a forsaken taps into the power of his psyche and calls to the
Forgotten Shadow, melting the mind of a fanatic bent on scourge his kin from the land.*
<br><br>
Through priests, the divine powers of the Light and Void channel into the world, mending wounds
or wreaking havoc. True mastery of these forces comes through worship to greater beings, such as
Elune, the Old Gods, or even the Holy Light itself. Whether devoted to the Light, or a servant of
the Void Lords, a priest is an ambassador for their deity, imbued by the energies they deliver.

### Agents of Light or Shadow
Wielding the power of the Holy Light, priests can unleash powerful healing energies to restore their
allies and undo harm. Manipulating the shadows from the Void equips a priest with devastating
abilities, able to bring complete chaos, shattering the minds of their foes. Careful balance and
discipline permits a priest to truly master the most absolute energies of the Universe, granting them
the ability to heal through shadow, and harm through the light.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

Comprehension of the light allows a priest to heal the most serious of wounds, and even undo
death. The power to wield the light doesn‘t require extensive practice or study, instead relying on
the user‘s faith in their own abilities. Those who follow the ways of the Void were often once
worshippers of the Light. As such, priests are among the most devout people in Azeroth.

A priest is incredibly useful in battle, no matter their discipline. Whether they heal their allies,
protect them from harm altogether, or blast the minds of their enemies into submission, few are
more effective than these devout followers of the Light and Shadow, especially when coupled with
their influence in greater society.

### Servants and Acolytes
Many across Azeroth practice divine magic, regardless of intermediaries, and as such many cults
have formed. Servitude of the Light brings restorative healing powers, while giving oneself to the
Shadow grants power over the mind, shadows and even insanity itself. A priestess of Elune taps
into powers of nature and the balance of sun and moon, while a priest of death calls to the Lich
King to curse his foes.

Whether good or evil, a priest will rarely abandon their cause, often fighting to the death, or
sacrificing themselves in place of an ally. Finding someone as loyal as a priest is a rare thing indeed.

Found all over Azeroth, a priest of the Church of the Holy Light brings healing and restorative
powers in times of peace, and protection in times of war, a true advocate for good. A death priest of
the Lich King or a follower of the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow manipulates the shadows to bring
death and destruction to their enemies, warping their minds into madness, often serving evil
purposes, though not always. A follower of Elune can serve her goddess‘s will, setting out to right
wrongs or to retrieve articles of the faith.

\pagebreakNum

It is not unheard of for servants of the Light to use it for evil. Since the Light responds to belief
that one‘s actions are right, which makes it impossible to wield it in the knowledge that one‘s
action are truly evil.

Absolute faith is crucial to harnessing the Light, which is why priests make excellent servants. Many
priests that have abandoned the Light and have opted to harness darker energies retain their
devotion, and while many question their motives, their faith is unwavering, and they continue to
serve their deity.

### Creating a Priest
Priest of Azeroth are known as priests or clerics, depending on their domains and focus. They
channel their power through their conviction, not through the direct power of their patrons. The
Scarlet Crusade, for example, channel the Holy Light due to their belief in their cause, although
many betray principles the Church of the Holy Light considers tenants of the faith.

As you create your priest, always remember the faith you serve and the ideals your character
conveys. Decide how your character came into the service of that particular faith or cult, such as
through divine intervention or through your character‘s own choosing. Are you renowned as a
devout follower of your deity, a fanatic, a troublemaker? How do others of your faith perceive you?
If you have an ultimate goal, keep it in mind when you advance your character.

Priests may be of any alignment and allegiance.

Priests serve their faith--either that of the Light through the Holy priesthood, the Old Gods though
the Shadow priesthood, the Lich King through the Death priesthood, taking a neutral stance
between the forces of the world with Discipline priesthood, or serving the Moon goddess Elune
through the universally-female Moon priesthood.

#### Quick Build
You can make a priest quickly by following these suggestions. First, Spirit should be your highest
ability score, followed by Strength or Stamina. Second, choose the acolyte background. Third,

#### Priesthood
Choose one priesthood or domain related to your deity: Death (Lich King), Discipline (Balance),
Holy (Holy Light), Moon (Elune), or Shadow (Forgotten Shadow). Each priesthood is detailed at
the end of the class description. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you
choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that
feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

#### Spellcasting
As a practitioner of divine magic, you draw your power from the divines themselves, channeling
their will through your body.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A priest can conjure and bind aberrations, beasts, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, oozes, and
undead, as well homunculi creatures (creatures with the homunculus template).

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each priest level provides you with 1 caster level in the priest class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell
list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells by consulting your libram (treat as a spellbook)
after a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute
per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Spirit is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells, since you learn your priest spells through
dedication to a higher force.

You use your Spirit whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Spirit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier

##### Priesthood Spells
Each priesthood has a list of spells—its priesthood spells—that you gain at the priest levels noted in
the priesthood description. Once you gain a priesthood spell, you always have it prepared, and it
doesn‘t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a priesthood spell that doesn‘t appear on the priest spell list, the spell is nonetheless a
priest spell for you.

##### Spellbook – Libram
At 1st level, your libram contains six 1st-level priest spells of your choice. When you level up, you
gain 2 additional priest spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research, tutelage,
or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your libram is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by scribing in your insights
regarding the secrets of the powers you serve.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

#### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals
10 + your Agility modifier + your Spirit modifier.

#### Desperate Prayer
Starting at 1st level, you may rapidly recover your mana by invoking your diety in a desperate prayer. You can use your action and bonus action on your turn to regain up to 20 mana points.

You replenish your reserve of power when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, holy power suffuses you, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting you advantage to saving throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

#### Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that
energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Invoke Power and an effect
determined by your priesthood. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels,
as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect
to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class,
the DC equals your priest spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity
twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests. When you
finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

##### Channel Divinity: Invoke Power
As a bonus action, you present your symbol and speak a prayer to your patron power, filling you with mysterious strength. The next spell you cast within 1 minute has its mana cost reduced by 4 points (minimum 0).

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Divine Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is
great.

Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower
than your priest level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the
effect of any priest spell or priesthood spell would be appropriate.

Imploring your deity‘s aid requires you to use your action.

If your deity intervenes, you can‘t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again
after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll
required.

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

### Death Priesthood
You follow the Lich King, gaining unholy powers from your devotion to the Dark Lord of the
Dead. Death priesthoods are feared and reviled figures in civilized societies, as they are often seen
as harbingers for a Scourge invasion.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Death Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Bane, sleep |
| 3rd | Gentle repose, see invisibility |
| 5th | Conjure undead (animate undead), speak with dead |
| 7th | Blight, drain life |
| 9th | Contagion, unhallow |

</div>

#### Death Can Wait
At first level, you gain advantage against all Death Saving Throws, attempts to
stabilize, and saves against necromancy spell effects.

You may also sacrifice yourself ritually to become a shade, gaining incorporeality (see Introduction),
but becoming unable to cast spells. You gain telepathy with who sacrificed you, and may
communicate with them and share what you see as an action from their part. This remains so long
as you and your lord are in the same plane. The connection may be willingly transferred to another
creature. The transformation is complete after one day of death, and cannot be reversed short of a
wish spell or divine intervention.

#### Lich King’s Favor
Starting at 2nd level, you add all necromancy spells from all spell lists to your spell list. Using necromancy spells that are not on your spell list cost 2 additional mana points.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Living
Also starting at 2nd level, you can, as an action, present your
symbol and speak a prayer censuring the living. Each living creature that can see or hear you within
30 feet of you must

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:320px;"></div>

make a Spirit saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for
1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's
nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

When you reach 5th level, you can also outright destroy the living you turn with this feature.
When a living creature fails its saving throw against your Turn Living feature, the creature is
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Turn
Living table. It disintegrates, leaving only a pile of dust, so commands the Lich King.

##### Turn Living Table
| Priest Level | Destroys Living of CR |
|:---:|:---:|
| 5th | 1/2 or lower
| 8th | 1 or lower
| 11th | 2 or lower
| 14th | 3 or lower
| 17th | 4 or lower

#### Death Denied
Starting at 6th level, you may release a burst of shadow as an action. This acts as the death nova spell. After you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest, or until you have made at least one death saving throw.

#### Death's Touch
At 8th level, you may use an action to target any dying creature within 90 feet with
a ranged spell attack. The creature fails one death saving throw instantly. You also have Resistance
to shadow damage.

#### Avatar of Death
At 17th level you have the ―Command Undead‖ ability as if you were a
Necromancer equal to your priest level. Also, whenever you defeat a creature using a necromancy
spell, they cannot be resurrected or reincarnated so long as you have not dropped to 0 hit points
since you defeated them. They can however be raised as undead.

### Discipline Priesthood
You follow the tenets of balance and self-improvement, balancing the forces of Light and Shadow
within you—a concept often called Chakra training. Your magics can shield allies from taking
damage as well as heal their wounds. Discipline priests do not advertise themselves, but act as other
priests.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Discipline Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Arcane armor, sanctuary |
| 3rd | Aid (or power word fortitude), levitate |
| 5th | Remove curse, warding bond |
| 7th | Death ward, stoneskin |
| 9th | Hold (up to 4 creature types), telekinesis |

</div>

#### Chakra Ward
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield,
you take 3 less damage from all slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage (minimum 1).

#### Extended Wards
Also beginning at 1st level, you double the duration of any active spell that
grants temporary hit points and all Power Word spells.

#### Channel Divinity: Atonement
Starting at level 2, you may, as an action, use a channel divinity
attempt to grant any ally within 30 ft. a polar link to your spells. Whenever you deal damage via a
priest spell to a target within 30 feet of the warded ally, the warded creature regains Hit Points
equal to 2 + the spell‘s level (or only 2 for a cantrip). This effect remains for one minute.

This feature has no effect if the mana cost of the spell has been reduced to 0.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

#### Channel Divinity: Penance
Starting at level 2, you may, as an action, use channel divinity to
enhance up to 3 targets within 30 ft. with Penance until the end of your turn in the next round. If
a target who benefits from Penance takes damage, you can choose to grant that target resistance
against any damage type you specify, and end the Penance effect for the remaining targets. If all the
targets suffer damage at the same time (such as from an area of effect ability or spell), they all
benefit, and the effect ends for them.

#### Restitution
Starting at 6th level, whenever a creature benefitting from your Channel Divinity: Penance ability suffers damage; you may deflect a fraction of the damage back to the aggressor as a
reaction if it is within 60 ft. If multiple targets are damaged at the same time (such as by suffering
from an area of effect ability or spell), you can deflect the damage to the source, so long as it is
within 60 ft.

In both cases, this requires a successful ranged spell attack, and on a success, the creature damaging
the warded targets take damage equal to half all the damage they dealt. This does not alter the type
of damage dealt.

Furthermore, if you use Channel Divinity: Penance a creature that is already a target of your
Channel Divinity: Atonement, roll a d4. On a roll of 2 to 4, the Channel Divinity is not spent, and
can be used again.

#### Chakra Cleansing
Starting at 8th level, whenever you cast the Power Word Shield spell, you may apply one of the two effects as a bonus action.
* You may dispel a magical effect the target suffers from. This acts as dispel magic with a spell level equal to the level of the Power Word Shield spell.
* You may grant additional temporary hit points equal to double the spell‘s level.

#### Infused Shield
Starting at 17th level, whenever you cast a healing or the Power Word Shield spell, you may freely convert temporary hit points from your priest spells to actual hit points, or vice versa. A healing spell that grants temporary hit points is counted as a shielding spell, and benefits from the Chakra Cleansing and Extended Wards abilities.

Furthermore, you may use your Channel Divinity: Penance ability as a reaction instead of an
action.

### Holy Light Priesthood
You are a vessel of the Holy Light‘s will, a versatile healer who can reverse damage on individuals or
groups and even heal from beyond the grave. Holy priests are well-adored and respected among the
Alliance.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Holy Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Bless, holy light |
| 3rd | Lesser restoration, spiritual weapon |
| 5th | Haste (or light‘s speed), revivify |
| 7th | Death ward, guardian of faith |
| 9th | Mass cure wounds (or hope of healing), mass revivify |

</div>

#### Light’s Insight
Starting at 1st level, whenever you cast a healing spell from the priest spell list and
the dice shows the maximum possible result (such as a 6 on a d6), you may roll the maximized dice
again and add the amount healed to the total. This applies to healing spells that deal damage to
undead. This acts similarly to the Holy Vision ability of the holy oath. If having both features, and
if the re-rolled dice results in a maximum result as well, you may roll a third time.

#### Light’s Embrace
Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use
a priest spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional
hit points equal to 2 + the spell‘s level. If the spell heals multiple creatures, the additional healing is
added to the total, not to each creature.

You may also turn fiends when you use your Channel Divinity to turn undead.

#### Channel Divinity: Restore Life
Starting at 2nd level, you may use your action while presenting
your holy symbol to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times
your priest level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can‘t
use this feature on a construct, but may target undead to damage by expending healing, dealing
holy damage instead of healing them.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
Also starting at 2nd level, you can, as an action, present your
holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you
within 30 feet of you must make a Spirit saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's
nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

When you reach 5th level, you can also outright destroy undead you turn with this feature.

When an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly
destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Turn Undead
table.

##### Turn Undead Table

| Priest Level | Destroys Undead of CR |
|:---:|:---:|
| 5th | 1/2 or lower
| 8th | 1 or lower
| 11th | 2 or lower
| 14th | 3 or lower
| 17th | 4 or lower

#### Channel Divinity: Focused Light
Starting at 6th level, you may use a channel divinity to alter the
target and refresh the duration of any healing sigil spell you cast on a target. This may be used
outside your turn, possibly recovering from a dispelled sigil by shifting it to another target. This
requires a spell attack as normal. This costs a reaction if used outside your turn, and a bonus action
if on your turn.

#### Angelic Form
Starting at 8th level, you gain the avatar form priest spell for no cost if you didn‘t
already have it. Furthermore, you augment the spell in the following ways:
* You can cast the spell as a reaction when reduced to 0 hit points. When this happens, the
  spell also restores one-quarter your full hit points and mana. If you enter the avatar form
  this way cast healing, restorative, and domain spells so long as the form persists.
* When you cast the spell, you can dispel one magical effect on you (as if by the dispel magic
  spell, spell level equal to the avatar form spell).
___
After the spell‘s duration ends, you return to your normal form, and are reduced to 10% of your
maximum hit points. You also learn celestial, if you don‘t already know how to speak it.

#### Guardian Spirit
Starting at 17th level, you may target any ally within 30 ft., granting them a
guardian angel spirit. This spirit increases the amount of healing taken from all your priest spells by
25%, and may be sacrificed to either grant resistance against any one attack the target, or
automatically stabilize the target if they are reduced to 0 hit points. This does not affect constructs
or undead. This may be used once per rest.

### Moon Priesthood
You are part of the ancient and well-respected sisterhood of the night-elven moon goddess Elune,
and your path is of serenity, grace, and reflection. Moon priestesses favor using subtlety, the
bow, and hit-and-run techniques to guard her flock, but act in accordance with the two faces of the
moon.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Moon Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Shot array (all except black arrow), trueshot aura |
| 3rd | Invisibility, moonbeam |
| 5th | Remove curse, shooting star |
| 7th | Dominate, hallucinatory terrain |
| 9th | Dream, starfall |

</div>

#### Facets of the Moon Goddess
Upon choosing this priesthood, you become attuned to the dual
faces of Elune, the goddess of the moon. Whenever the moon (or one moon of your realm) enters a
new phase, you may adapt that aspect of Elune. This choice is made at the end of a long rest. This
changes how some of your priesthood features act.
* *Full Moon Aspect.* The full moon aspect of Elune is known as the Mother Moon. It is more
  adept with healing and providing support, as well as ranged combat, and represents calm
  wisdom and righteous, precise action.
* *New Moon.* The new moon aspect of Elune is known as the Night Warrior. It is more adept
  with melee combat, and represents the furious savagery of nature, vengeful aspects of the
  goddess, and her shepherding the souls of the dead to beyond the stars.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:400px;"></div>

You are also always able to see the moon (or its outline, if it if you have line of sight to it, even in
daylight. In the new moon phase, you can see the moon‘s outline. You cannot gain normally
benefits from observing it except at night, however, when Elune‘s power waxes, unless the power
specifies so.

#### Might of the Moon
Starting at 1st level, so long as you can observe the moon and are at night, you
are affected by the inner fire spell (level equal to highest spell level you can access). In other
conditions, the bonus provided by the spell is halved (minimum 0).

You do not require have to be outdoors to benefit from this feature. If there are multiple moons in
the realm you are in, any moon suffices.

#### Favor of Elune
Also starting at 1st level, you gain the Favored by Elune talent, and gain
proficiency with all ranged projectile weapons and medium armor. You also gain a one of the
following blessings, depending on the lunar phase you have chosen.
<br>
*Full Moon Priestess* You may add your spirit modifier to damage rolls with bows of all types.
<br>
*New Moon Priestess* You may choose one fighting style (chosen from the list of the warrior class).

#### Channel Divinity: Moonlight Calm
Starting at 2nd level, when you channel divinity, you may
channel an aspect of Elune‘s grace to calm a creature within 30 feet of you. You may target a
humanoid or beast, or a creature in another shape (such as a druid in wild shape or a shapeshifter).
* If you target a beast or humanoid, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or it
  is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is
  friendly to you and other creatures you designate. If you treat them fairly, they do not revert to
  their original hostility after the duration ends.

* If you target a Druid in their Wild Shape or a shapeshifting creature, they revert to their
  original shape if they fail a Charisma saving throw, and cannot shapeshift for one minute. They
  may repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn every round.

#### Channel Divinity: Moonlight Ward
Starting at 6th level, you may spend a Channel Divinity use
as a bonus action and designate one ally within 30 feet as your moonlight ward. The ward remains
for 1 minute. Depending on the phase of the moon, your ward has one of the following effects:
* *Full Moon*. So long as the ally remains within range, you may use a bonus action to heal the
  target with any healing spell from the priest spell list that normally requires an action. If the
  spell normally costs a bonus action to cast (such as the flash of light spell), it may instead cast it
  as a reaction.
* *New Moon*. So long as the ally within range, you can cast any spell that deals psychic or shadow
  damage as a bonus action so long as you target a creature who attacked your moonlit ward in
  the last round. If the spell normally costs a bonus action to cast (such as the flash of light spell),
  it may instead cost a reaction. You cannot cast sigil spells this way.
___
If you successfully dealt weapon damage to an enemy before using the moonlight ward, the mana cost of the spell (healing or damaging, respectively) is reduced by 2 (minimum 1). This can stack with the normal reduction for repeat-casting a spell.

#### Elune’s Grace
Starting at 8th level, you can bless creatures with a shard of your goddess‘s grace.
Depending on your chosen phase, you can grant a creature you affect by your spells one of the
below blessings. Once you use the blessings three times, you cannot bless another creature until you
complete a short rest. You may use multiple blessings per round (they do not require an action).
* *Full Moon*. You priest spells that restore hit points heal the maximum amount for the dice for
  one target.
* *New Moon*. Your priest spells that deal psychic or shadow damage deal maximum damage for
  the dice for one target.
___
If you are under the effects of the avatar form priest spell, you can use the blessing two additional
times before a short rest.

#### Moon's Luck
Starting at 17th level, you gain the Lucky feat. You have a number of Luck Points
equal to half of your Priest level (rounded down) in the following conditions, depending on the
phase you have chosen:
* *Full Moon*. When you are under direct moonlight.
* *New Moon*. When you are under the new moon.
___
You may use Luck Points to use your Elune‘s Grace feature instead of the number of limited
blessings. In other conditions to the ones specified, each Luck Point has half the benefit (requiring
spending two points instead of one for a benefit of the feat).

### Shadow Priesthood
You answered the call of the Old Gods, joining the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow, gaining powers
over the eldritch mysteries and powers of the ancient changed beings. Shadow Priests use sinister
shadow magic, especially sigil spells, to eradicate enemies.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Shadow Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Dissonant whispers, sleep |
| 3rd | Fear, hex array (only dream eat) |
| 5th | Blight, curse of weakness |
| 7th | Black tentacles (or old gods‘ grasp), confusion |
| 9th | Hold (up to 4 creature types), vampiric aura |

</div>

#### Shadow Orbs
Starting at 1st level, whenever you successfully deal psychic damage to an enemy
through a spell or ability, you gain one Shadow orb. This applies once per spell. Shadow orbs
spheres may be used to empower your abilities. Shadow Orbs may be spent for the following.
* Meld into Madness. Reduce the mana cost of one priest spell you cast. The reduction in mana cost is 2 points per Shadow orb removed (minimum mana cost 1). For each level of madness you have, a single Shadow orb can reduce the mana cost by 1 points (round down) instead.
* Prey on the Psyche. Deal 1 additional point of psychic damage per damage dice with spells
  and abilities that deal psychic damage. This can be spent after rolling for damage, and
  applies once per spell. This does not stack with similar abilities.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:420px;"></div>

___
You may have a maximum number of orbs equal to 2 plus your Proficiency bonus, and they remain
for one hour after being acquired.

#### Mind Quickening
Also starting at 1st level, your expanded mind gives you the ability to touch the
minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within
30 feet of you. You don‘t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your
telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

You may also pronounce the verbal components of your priest spells mentally, so that only the
target can hear them. This way, you cast spells in areas of silence or while muted, so long as at least
one target of the spell is within 30 feet and within line of sight.

#### Attuned to the Void
Starting at 2nd level, you may dip your spells into the raw maddening power
of the Void, coloring them permanently. Choose a number of priest spells equal to your proficiency
bonus.

You may scribe such spells that deal damage with other energy types as psychic or shadow spells in
your spellbook. The spells act the same way, unless the DM rules it is unreasonable.

#### Channel Divinity: Devouring Plague
Also starting at 2nd level, you may use an action while
presenting your unholy symbol to evoke dark energy, dealing psychic damage equal to five times
your priest level, halved with a Spirit saving throw. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and
divide the damage among them. This feature can reduce a creature to no more than half of its hit
point maximum. You can‘t use this feature on undead or constructs. You regain hit points equal to
the total damage you dealt.

If you have at least one shadow orb before using this ability, you may choose to gain no shadow
orbs from this ability‘s use for the round, and share the healing gained with them (costing one
shadow orb to include one creature in the sharing).

You may reduce the amount of hit points you (and your chosen allies) can potentially gain from this ability and convert the healing energies to mana restoration. Every 5 hit points of healing is converted to 1 mana point. Once you restore a total amount of mana using this ability equal to your priest level, you cannot restore mana until you complete a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Focused Psyche
Starting at 6th level, you may use a channel divinity to alter the
target and refresh the duration of any damaging sigil spell you cast on a target. This may be used
outside your turn, possibly recovering from a dispelled sigil by shifting it to another target. This
requires a spell attack as normal. This costs a reaction if used outside your turn, and a bonus action
if on your turn.

#### Shadow Form
Starting at 8th level, you gain the avatar form priest spell for no cost if you didn‘t
already have it. Furthermore, you augment the spell in the following ways:
* You can cast the spell as a reaction when reduced to 0 hit points. When this happens, the
  spell also restores one-quarter your full hit points and mana, and grants you 4 Shadow
  orbs. If you enter the avatar form this way, you can only cast psychic, sigil, and domain
  spells so long as the form persists.
* When you cast the spell, you can dispel one magical effect on you (as if by the dispel magic
  spell, spell level equal to the avatar form spell).
___
After the spell‘s duration ends, you return to your normal form, and are reduced to 10% of your
maximum hit points. You also learn shath‘yar, if you don‘t already know how to speak it.

#### Vampiric Embrace
Starting at 17th level, whenever you deal damage with a damaging sigil or
psychic effect, you may can count one-quarter the damage dealt and grant it as healing to allies
within 30 feet of the target, dividing the healing evenly. You may instead divide the damage by ten,
and grant it as mana restoration to the same number of targets.

Unlike normal mana restoration effects, this can benefit a target up to three times before it cannot
be used again for an hour, although you cannot restore more mana to yourself than the cost of the
spell you used.

## Rogue (RGE)

*A hooded figure walks towards the entrance of a shop,
as a crow as black as night flies from its rest above the
shop‘s sign. The human shopkeeper studies the man
carefully, before sliding a book from its shelf. The
bookcase slowly creaks open and the hooded figure
enters the dark passage. As the figure passes, they toss
a single silver piece with an odd symbol to the counter
top, which is quickly collected by the shopkeep.*
<br><br>
*Lost, a traveler finds a mansion in the middle of the
woods. Starving and cold, she approaches the manor.
Inside the guests lay motionless, slumped over their
dinner. She slowly walks up to the head of the table, where she sees the heavy frame of a man. She
notices a wide cut in his neck, as a sharp pain is felt in her chest. As the traveler looks down, a
black dagger protrudes from her abdomen. Falling to the ground she sees the rotten grin of a
forsaken, as blood spills to the ground and she draws her last breath.*
<br><br>
*In a run-down inn on the coast, a band of sailors drink and sing merrily into the night. Suddenly a
goblin, clad in leather and armed with a shortsword and loaded pistol, strolls in. All faces turn to
the wanted sign across the room mirroring the goblin intruder‘s face. With a grin the goblin cocks
her pistol, and in a few moments, the goblin leaves the inn once more, swinging a few purses
stained with blood.*

### Skill and Precision
Rogues possess a wide range of skills that allow them to accomplish feats from finding secret doors
to smacking a magic item until it works. They are excellent in a fight, and if they can strike quickly
or unseen — or are flanking an enemy with the help of a thoughtful ally — they can be truly deadly.
Of course, they also excel at stealth.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

The rogues of Azeroth are the masters of subterfuge, skilled and cunning adversaries of those who
dare not look into the shadows to see what lurks there. Roguery is a profession for those who seek
the adventures of stalking in silent forests, dimly lit halls, and heavily guarded strongholds. Using
trickery in combat and able to vanish at the slightest distraction, the rogue is a welcome addition to
any group of adventurers. Ideal spies, deadly to those they can catch unaware, rogues have no
problem finding a place in the world. Deadly masters of stealth, rogues are the whispers in shadowy
corners and the hooded figures crossing dark fields. Skilled with daggers and the art of silent death,
these vagabonds and bandits skulk about Azeroth seeking targets and profit. A member of almost
any race can learn the tricks necessary to become a skilled rogue. Still, for the tauren and draenei,
such a profession is an alien concept and therefore rare among those peoples. Whether they are
diplomats, spies, thieves, scoundrels, entertainers, or simply adventurers, they can be found plying
just about any trade from Mount Hyjal to Ratchet.

### A Shady Living
Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They‘re the shadows
in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike—then they dispatch an
opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are
opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there‘s an unparalleled art to what they do.

From the high-contract assassin hired in secret by respected noblemen to the lowly street mugger,
rogues are the ones called upon when maintaining the status quo requires a questionable solution
— and by fulfilling it, they are branded as outcasts by the very society that calls upon their service.

\pagebreakNum

In Azeroth, rogues are largely free agents, though some prefer to join an organization for safety and
ease of employment. Ravenholdt and the Syndicate are examples. Other recognized rogue
organizations include the Shattered Hand, the Deathstalkers, and SI:7.

### Creating a Rogue
As you create your rogue character, consider the character‘s relationship to the law. Do you have a
criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves‘ guild master?
Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you
in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?

What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone
terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery
gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life.

Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself out off
from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you
made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities
for earning a living and employing your particular talents.

Rogues represent thieves, treasure-hunters, cunning spies, and aspiring adventurers. Using their
skills and cunning (and sometimes gifted with a knack for technology or strange magics), rogues are
always welcome to any faction, and many works for more than two at any given time as scouts,
double agents, and false merchants.

For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the
constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins
and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and
vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground.

#### Quick Build
You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First. Agility should be your highest
ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation. Choose
Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the
charlatan background.

\pagebreakNum

#### Expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your
proficiency with thieves‘ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make
that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves‘ tools) to gain
this benefit.

#### Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe‘s distraction. Once per turn,
you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on
the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don‘t need advantage on the
attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn‘t incapacitated, and
you don‘t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak
Attack column of the Rogue table.

#### Thieves’ Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves‘ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that
allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows
thieves‘ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it
does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols
used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a
thieves‘ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will
provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

#### Rogue Talent
Starting at 2nd level, you gain a class talent, representing your ability to function under pressure or
perform specialized tasks, either by quick thinking, good use of skill, special aptitude towards
magic, or by lightning-fast reflexes. See Class Talents at the end of the Chapter 3 for options.

Whenever you qualify for another talent (as detailed in the talent column), you can choose another
talent or gain another use of an existing talent.

#### Roguish Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities:
Assassination, which focuses on capturing the opponent unawares a quickly dispatching of them,
Outlaw, which focuses on dueling and swashbuckling, and Subtlety, which attunes one‘s self with
shadows so much that they begin to aid him. All are detailed at the end of the class description.
Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one
ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or
invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

#### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a
target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you
can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can‘t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/j0RJ7pI.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; left:-40px; width:100%; height:100%;' />

### Assassination
You are deadly master of poisons, who can dispatch various victims with vicious dagger strikes and
amazing talents. Assassins are usually independent agents who perform contracts with various
organizations to further their own goals.

#### Assassinate
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies.

You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn‘t taken a turn in the combat yet.

In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

Also, if you don‘t already have proficiency with a poisoner‘s kit, you gain proficiency in it, and you
gain advantage to saving throws against your own poisons.

#### Disrupting Strike [Strike]
Also starting at 3rd level, you gain experience in fighting casters.

Whenever you deal sneak attack damage with a melee weapon, you may give up a portion of the
damage to inflict on the target the distracted condition for one round per 1d6 of sneak attack given
up.

#### Dispatch
Starting at 9th level, whenever attacking a target that is bloodied, your sneak attack dice
improves from 1d6 to d10.

#### Expert Poisoner
Starting at 13th level, the Poisoned condition if delivered by you also inflicts
disadvantage on one saving throw type you choose for the duration of the condition. You also
gather triple the normal amount of crafting materials for poisons when harvesting (such as from
raw materials or from creatures).

#### Vendetta
Starting at 17th level, you may mark one target within 100 feet with an action, and have
advantage to all Perception checks to perceive them, as well as advantage to the first attack of every
turn against them. The benefits remain for one minute, and may be used once before a short rest.

.

\columnbreak

### Outlaw
You are a swashbuckler, duelists, or combatant who uses agility and guile to stand toe-to-toe with
opponents. Outlaw rogues are usually pirates and highwaymen.

#### Riposte
Starting at 3rd level, you may deflect an incoming attack by using a reaction, thereby
adding your Proficiency bonus to your AC. If your AC is then high enough to make the enemy
miss after it would have been a success, you can make an attack of opportunity against the enemy.

Outlaw rogues also gain proficiency with firearms and explosives.

#### Revealing Strike [Strike]
Also at 3rd level, a target struck with this ability must make an Agility
saving throw contested by your own. If you succeed, the target loses all increases to AC from a
single type against all targets for until the end of your next round. This may be used to nullify
armor bonuses, insight bonuses, or Agility bonuses, but not all three.

A creature that suffers the effects of Revealing Strike cannot be targeted again for 24 hours. This is
a strike effect that costs a bonus action.

#### Quick Combatant
Beginning at 9th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.

If you roll a successful attack roll with one of these attacks, you may forgo dealing damage with that
attack to give yourself advantage on the next attack you make. This may only be done with melee
attacks.

#### Disabling Strike [Strike]
Starting at 13th level, your keen eye and calculating mind makes your
Sneak Attacks even more potent. Whenever you succeed on an attack that deals Sneak Attack
damage, you may elect to not deal sneak attack damage, and force your target to make an Agility
saving throw contested by your own. If the target fails the saving throw, it gains one of the following
conditions at your choice.
* Slowed by 1/2 their normal movement rate for until the end of its turn in the next round.
* Blinded for until the end of its turn in the next round.
* Stunned for until the end of its turn in the next round.
___
This is a strike effect that costs a bonus action. A creature cannot suffer more than once against
your Disabling Strike in 24 hours. If you have the dire strike ability, you can deal half your sneak
attack damage when applying a dire strike.

#### Killing Spree
Starting at 17th level, you tap into your reserves of speed, going into a killing spree.

While you are in this state, you may double your movement and gain advantage on your first attack
at the beginning of every round. Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. This state
remains for 1 minute, or until you spend one of your rounds without making an attack roll or if
you are not targeted with an attack roll. This may be used once per short rest.

\pagebreakNum

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/j0RJ7pI.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; left:-40px; width:100%; height:100%;' />

### Subtlety
Your affinity with shadows reached beyond the mundane, tapping into shadowy arcane powers.
Subtlety rogues are often spies who sell their secrets to the highest bidder.

#### Shadow Spellcasting
Drawing on mysterious shadow-magics, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. You
cast spells drawn from the Mage spell list, and are restricted to spells from the Conjuration,
Evocation, Enchantment, and Illusion schools. You may also scribe spells in Thieves‘ Cant. You
also gain a spellbook as a 1st-level mage.

You gain bonus spells on your 8th, 14th, and 20th level. These spells can be of any schools.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus.
One of your cantrips must be the mage hand cantrip.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each rogue level provides you with 0.5 a caster level in the Mage class (minimum 0). You follow the
normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of Mage spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the mage spell
list. Your spellcasting otherwise follows the same rules as the mage class (with regards to which
creatures you can conjure, spellbooks, etc.). Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence.

#### Premeditation
Also on 3rd level, you may use 3 rounds (counted as 3 actions) to study an enemy.

If you do, you may always apply your sneak attack damage against them (even without advantage or
an ally nearby) for one minute, unless the target moves more than their full speed in one round. In
addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

#### Vanish
Starting at 9th level, you may grant yourself invisibility as a reaction. This invisibility
remains until the end of your next turn. This may be used once per point of Intelligence modifier,
and replenishes after a short rest.

#### Shadow Dance
Starting at 13th level, you may initiate a shadow dance by moving more than 10
feet. While in this stance, you grant yourself concealment as per the blur spell. Also while in the
stance, creatures affected or distracted by your mage spells (such as a summoned monster or an
image illusion, but not the distracted condition) grant you advantage to your first attack at any
round. This may be used once per short rest, and remains so long as you continue moving.

#### Backstab
Starting at 17th level, when you target a bloodied creature with a sneak attack, you may
deal double the sneak attack damage. Once affected, the target is immune to this ability until they
complete a short rest.

## Shaman (SHM)
*A tauren standing atop a cliff calmly raises his hand,
leaning on a giant halberd, sprinkling reagents upon
the grasslands below. The golden dust is carried on a
spirit of the wind. A giant totem bound to his back
trembles in approval.*
<br><br>
*A red-bearded dwarf stands on shaking ground,
unmoved, as the earth cracks before him, spewing the
beginnings of lava. As his comrades collapse, he
points at it with commanding presence, shouting in a
primordial tongue that speaks to the very earth. The
beginnings of a chaotic volcanic eruption slow, before
the primal powers of the earth and fire retreat,
calmed, back into the earth.*
<br><br>
*Cleaving through fiendish foes with a bloodied axe in one hand and lightning-enhanced attack
claws in the other, the orc shouts a war cry to rally his allies. Bearing a wolf-pelt over his shoulders,
he raises an olive-skinned arm to the skies, summoning a bolt of lightning from the stormy clouds
before, which he then sends at a gathering of demons with a resounding clap of thunder.*
<br><br>
Shaman are mortal mediators between the very elements themselves. Often spiritual guides of their
communities, these powerful practitioners commune with the ancestors and seek to balance the
raging elemental forces, and can call upon them in battle to scorch and blast their enemies, or to
strengthen and heal their allies. Shaman can enhance their weapons with elemental effects, smite
enemies with lightning strikes and bursts of lava, and summon powerful elementals to their aid.

<div style="margin-top:520px;"></div>

### Spiritual Powers
Shaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike
some other mystics, shaman commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements
are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It
is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire,
water, and air, shaman summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman‘s allies or
punish those who threaten them.

Shaman are spiritual visionaries of tribes and clans. These gifted warriors can see into the world of
spirits and communicate with creatures invisible to the eyes of normal beings. They are beset by
visions of the future and use their sight to guide their people through troubled times. Although
shaman may seem wise and serene at first, they are formidable foes; when angered, their wrath is as
fierce as those who have a connection to divines or to nature.

During combat, shaman place damaging and controlling totems on the ground to maximize their
effectiveness while hindering their enemies. Shaman are versatile enough to battle foes up close or
at range, but wise shamans choose their avenue of attack based on their enemies' strengths and
weaknesses.

### Gift of the Elements
Commanding chaotic and conflicting elements, a shaman is a force that hears the world tremble
and directs its wrath. Communicating with spirits of flame, winds, and stone, shamans channel the

\pagebreakNum

power of the storm, earth, and fire to their will. A shaman‘s holy symbol is a small ancestral relic or
totem of bone, wood, or iron that can be carried in one‘s hand.

The elements are chaotic, however, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in
unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos, acting as
moderators among earth, fire, water, and air. The spirit of life is a hidden and elusive one, but
shamans often channel healing energies through water until they are able and proficient enough to
negotiate bringing the dead to life via invoking life spirits.

As shamans mediate between elemental spirits, it is unsurprising that such aptitude eventually
translates to connecting with other kinds of spirits as well, including that of incorporeal undead
(such as banshees or ghosts) or the shaman‘s own ancestors.

Besides the great shamanistic traditions of the orcs, Wildhammer dwarves are familiar with
shamanism in its ancestral worship form, and Tauren are most well-versed with the spirits of earth
and sky, both having traditions ancient to modern Azeroth.

### Creating a Shaman
When you create your shaman the most important question to ask is how you became attuned to
the spirits. Was it a natural event such as being born during a mystical meteor shower? Did terrible
dreams plague you as a child and it wasn‘t until you had matured that you realized the truth of your
abilities?

How does your character perceive their abilities? Maybe you view them as a duty to the souls
around you, an endless task to lend aid to the spirits and help them into the afterlife? Or even
perhaps you view the spirits as tools to advance your own plans, choosing to exploit the spirits you
see rather than helping them?

#### Quick Build
You can make a shaman quickly by following these suggestions. First, Spirit should be your highest
ability score, followed by Strength or Stamina. Second, choose the hermit background. Third,
choose the create bonfire, invoke elements, and thunderclap cantrips, along with the following 1st-level

</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Kalimag
You know Kalimag, the language of elementals and wind, earth, fire, and water spirits. You can
speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language
automatically spot such a message. If you can speak Kalimag, you can communicate with all other
shamans and elementals, even if you don‘t otherwise share a language.

#### Spellcasting
By 1st level, you have learned to draw on raw elemental might through meditation and
communication with the elements.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A shaman can conjure and bind aberrations, elementals, fiends, oozes, and undead, as well spirit
creatures (creatures with the spirit template).

Furthermore, you can be Called (see Calling, see Chapter 10) by the elements and elementals,
although they usually only call to ask for aid regarding circumstances that threaten the balance of
powers, such as extensive drilling efforts, an upcoming wildfire in a dry area, or a coming storm in
around 24 hours before they take place.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each shaman level provides you with 1 caster level in the shaman class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of shaman spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the shaman
spell list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells by consulting your totem (treat as a spellbook) after
a long rest. Preparing a new list of shaman spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute per
spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Spirit is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, since you learn your shaman spells through
primal contact with the elemental forces.

You use your Spirit whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Spirit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier

##### Spellbook – Master Totem
At 1st level, your totem contains six 1st-level shaman spells of your choice. When you level up, you
gain 2 additional shaman spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research,
tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your totem is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by meditating with it and burning
incense and rare herbs. This totem is usually also known as your spell totem.

\columnbreak

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your shamanistic symbol as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells. These are
typically totems, tufts of wolf hair, or a carving of your spiritual animal.

#### Shamanistic Art
Choose one shamanistic art or focus related to how you view the elements and how they have
received you, such as Elemental to focus on bringing the elements‘ wrath down, enhancement to
strengthen yourself through the elements, or restoration, in which the elements are in balance.
Each art is detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you art spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants
you additional ways to use Channel Elements when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and
additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

#### Art Spells
Each art has a list of spells—its art spells—that you gain at the shaman levels noted in the art
description. Once you gain an art spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn‘t count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have an art spell that doesn‘t appear on the
shaman spell list, the spell is nonetheless a shaman spell for you.

#### Channel Elements
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel elemental energy directly, using that energy to fuel
magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Elementals and an effect determined by your
art. Some arts grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the art description.

When you use your Channel Elements, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a
short or long rest to use your Channel Elements again.

Some Channel Elements effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class,
the DC equals your shaman spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
Elements twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests.
When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

##### Channel Elements: Turn Elementals
As an action, you present your shamanistic symbol and speak a prayer dismissing and quelling
elementals. Each elemental that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Spirit saving
throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can‘t
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can‘t take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there‘s
nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

While it is turned, you may also opt to calm the elemental, rendering it passive and not hostile for
one minute. If treated fairly and listened to, the elemental might reveal why it is angered, and may
demand from the shaman to address a problem that is wracking the elementals in the region (or
beyond).

\pagebreakNum

#### Mana Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you may rapidly recover your mana by invoking elemental energies. You can use your action and bonus action on your turn to regain up to 20 mana points.

You replenish your reserve of shamanistic power when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, elemental energies suffuse you, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting you advantage to saving throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Release Elemental
Starting at 5th level, when an elemental fails its saving throw against your Turn Elemental feature,
you may subject the creature to a dispel (as the dispel magic spell), release it from its bindings (if
bound by the bind or essence seal spells), return it to its realm of origin (as the banishment spell), or
destroy it outright if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Release
Elemental table. This ability only functions when you declare your intention to use it.

| Shaman Level  | Releases Elemental of CR |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| 5th | 1/2 or lower
| 8th | 1 or lower
| 11th | 2 or lower
| 14th | 3 or lower
| 17th | 4 or lower

If targeting an elemental whose essence is captured and is being used to fuel a device with an
elemental engine, you can cause it to suffer from the malfunctioned condition with a successful
spell attack against the wielder of the device. If the device already is malfunctioned, a successful
spell attack releases the elemental instead, which appears at any point between you and the device
(you can choose the point). Such elementals usually serve the shaman for 1 day or until they can
return the favor.

Destroying elementals is a secret art known to shamans, and is typically only used against
elementals that are corrupted by fel energies, as elementals are usually receptive to shamans who
turn them (see above).

#### Elemental Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on the elements of Azeroth to intervene on your behalf when
your need is great. Imploring the elements‘ aid requires you to use your action. Describe the
assistance you seek, and roll a percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your
shaman level, the elements intervene. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of
any shaman spell or art spell would be appropriate. This ability is treated as divine intervention in
all respects.

If the elements intervene, you can‘t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again
after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll
required.

### Elemental
Your ability to command the elements at long ranges, and influence and aid their allies at equal
distance is renowned and respected. Elementalists make up most adventuring shamans.
<br><br>
<div class="classTable">

#### Elemental Art Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Fog cloud, elemental shock |
| 3rd | Animal messenger (or animal spirit), gust of wind |
| 5th | Call lightning, sending |
| 7th | Control water, ice storm |
| 9th | Maelstrom, teleport circle (to areas of elemental power) |

</div>

#### Elemental Mastery
Starting at 1st level, you may change any elemental damage type dealt by your
shaman spells to another type. This requires a bonus action.

#### Acclimation
Also at 1st level, you are also immune to the hostile effects of weather. By spending
an action, you can determine the weather for the next 24 hours with a 50% degree of accuracy. You
can also sense any weather-changing spells when they are being cast within 5 miles of your location,
and can roughly identify whether the caster is a friend or foe to the elements or shamans.

Channel Elements: Wrath. At 2nd level, you can spend a Channel Elements use to wield the
power of the elements with unchecked ferocity. When you roll for any type of elemental damage,
you can use a Channel Elements attempt to deal maximum damage instead.

#### Elemental Mixing
Starting at 6th level, when you roll elemental damage from a shaman spell of
spell level 1 1st or higher, you can apply one of the following effects.
* *Earth Slide*. The target is pushed 10 feet in any direction you choose.
* *Fire Sear*. The target is scorched for one round.
* *Frost Snap*. The target is chilled for one round.
* *Storm Toss*. The target takes disadvantage to attack rolls.
___
These effects stack with others, whenever possible (such as by the elemental shock spell). For example,
an elemental shock that deals lightning (lightning shock) normally imposes the Storm Toss effect. You
can also add the Earth Slide effect to push the target as well.

#### Bonded Elemental
Starting at 8th level, you may conjure an elemental and render its duration
permanent. If the elemental dies, you can perform the ritual again to summon another. This
elemental does not require concentration to maintain and does not count against the normal limit
for the bind spell, with a maximum spell level rendered permanent equal to one-half the maximum
spell level of the elemental you can bond.

#### Elemental Storm
When you reach level 17, you gain the ability to summon a fully-realized
thunderstorm, snowstorm, or firestorm at your location. The earth is blanketed by a 5-mile radius
centered on you for one hour. This otherwise acts as control weather, and takes 10 minutes to cast
as normal. However, so long as the elemental storm is active, you may also use an action to cause a
10-foot wide cylinder of elemental wrath that deals 10d6 damage (thunder, lighting, cold, or fire,
depending on the storm type). The range of this ability is as far as you can see within the radius,
and the affected creatures are entitled an Agility saving throw to half damage.

Whenever you call the elemental cylinder, the dice damage is reduced by 2d6. When they reach
0d6, the storm ends prematurely (even if maintaining concentration), as the elemental spirits
become calmer. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until after a long rest.

### Enhancement
Your magic is woven to your combat style, empowering your ability harm their enemies in melee
combat. Enhancement shamans usually use two weapons.
<br><br>
<div class="classTable">

#### Enhancement Art Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Elemental tongue, shield
| 3rd | Conjure (Spirit Dire Wolf), earth shield
| 5th | Bloodlust, spirit infusion
| 7th | Death ward, freedom of movement (or grace of air)
| 9th | Windfury tongue, true seeing

</div>

#### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. Also, you gain the
Dual Wielder feat if you didn‘t already have it. If you already have it, you add +1 to your weapon
damage rolls with either weapon.

#### Elemental Command
Also at 1st level, you gain increased proficiency and command over the
elements. You may perform any of the following abilities a number of times equal to your Spirit
modifier. All such uses of elemental command are restored after a short rest.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:500px;"></div>

* *Command the Storm*. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an
  attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make an Agility saving throw. The
  creature takes 2d6 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half
  as much damage on a successful one. If they took at least 5 points of damage, they are pushed 5
  feet away. The damage increases by 1 dice for every two spell levels you can access above 1st
  level (up to 6d6).
* *Command the Earth*. You may send a tremor through the earth as a bonus action as an elemental
  command, unbalancing your enemies. In a 30-foot-sphere centered on you, you may send a
  shockwave, dealing 2d6 + your Spirit modifier in bludgeoning damage (or your off-handed
  weapon damage, whichever is higher), with an Agility saving throw to half damage. You may
  instead shape this as a 15-foot-long cone, or a 30-foot-long line. If you also have the Tremor
  talent, you may expend a use of Tremor. If you elect to do so, creatures who fail the Agility
  saving throw are also knocked prone and suffer 5 additional points of damage. The damage
  increases by 1 dice for every two spell levels you can access above 1st level (up to 6d6).
* *Command the Flame*. You may cast fire bolt as a bonus action or as a reaction as a use of
  elemental command. You may add this damage to your off-hand attack as part of the same
  action.
___
Also, choose one weapon you are proficient in and enhance it with a shard of your essence. So long
as you wield the weapon, it counts as a spellcasting focus, and you may use it to perform somatic
components of your shaman spells. You can only have one weapon enhanced this way.

\pagebreakNum

#### Channel Elements: Elementalist Combat
At 2nd level, you can spend a Channel Elements use to
invoke a blessing from the elementals. This does not cost an action. This blessing boosts your
combat capabilities beyond those even of experienced warriors for 1 minute. While this blessing is
active, your strike and shot effects do not cost a bonus action to apply, so long as they are from the
shaman class or from shaman spells. Furthermore, if you successfully affect the target with two
attacks or more, you may push the creature up to 10 feet away (plus an additional 10 feet for each
extra attack), so long as it is not more than one size category larger you. If the strike would normally
push the enemy, the forced movement does not stack.

The blessing ends early if you are knocked unconscious, or if their turn ends without being
attacked or attacking a hostile creature, or if not casting a non-cantrip shaman spell.
Flurry. Starting at 6th level, when you take an action to attack, you can attack twice instead of
once.

#### Spirit Wolves
Starting at 8th level, you can summon two dire wolves with the spirit template as an
action, which take their turns immediately after yours. The wolves dissipate after 5 minutes, and do
not require concentration. So long as the wolves are within 10 feet of you, your movement speed
increases to match their own.

Furthermore, whenever you succeed on more than two attacks and the spirit wolves are within 30
feet of you, they can make an attack of opportunity as a reaction against any creature that is within
5 feet of them. If either succeeds on attacking, you regain 1d6+1 hit points.

After using this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. The DM has the
wolves‘ statistics, and applies the spirit template appropriately. The dire wolves‘ Challenge is always
of a value equal to one-eighth your shaman level (allowing you to enhance them, as described in the
Monster Guide). For the purpose of this ability, the spirit template does not increase the effective CR of the wolves.

#### Greater Investitures
Starting at 17th level, you can may cast one of the four ‘Investiture‘ spells
(Investiture of Flame, Investiture of Wind, etc.) with a use of Elemental Command.

While under the effects of one of the spells, whenever you cast the elemental shock or elemental tongue
spells that deals the same damage type as described in the investiture (if any), the spell deals double
damage (as if a critical hit). This can stack with a critical hit (up to triple damage).

## Restoration
You focuses on magic that heals and divines the future—your totems, as a consequence, are stronger
than that of other paths. Restoration shamans are often thought of as more spiritual than others,
and are known as witch-shamans or spirit-walkers.
<br><br>
<div class="classTable">

#### Restoration Art Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Healing ward, riptide
| 3rd | Ancestral guardians, totemic recall
| 5th | Healing stream, revivify (or ancestral sight)
| 7th | Death ward, spirit link totem
| 9th | Healing stream totem, tranquility (or healing rain)

</div>

#### Ancestral Blessing
At 1st level, whenever you heal a creature, you add your Spirit modifier to the
total amount of healing given. This applies once per spell. If the target is blood-related to you or
sworn to the same blood-oath, the benefits of this ability is doubled for them. See Chapter 10 for
details on Blood Oaths.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

#### Elusive Totems
Also starting at 1st level, you may move any or all of your totems up to half your
own speed as a reaction, not as a bonus action. This cannot interrupt an attack, but gives the totem
a bonus to AC equal to your Spirit modifier versus an attack you react to.

You also increase their hit points by your level (to a total of three times your level). Totems also
gain the benefit of the Evasion rogue ability when using your Agility saving throw bonus.

Lastly, if one of your totems is destroyed, you regain one-quarter the mana cost you spent on it.
If you are traveling overland with totems out, they move with you.

#### Channel Elements: Life-Link
Starting at 2nd level, you may channel the elements and spend an action to replicate the effect of the spirit link spell (even if you normally cannot cast it).

Furthermore, whenever a
creature is healed, the healing is also distributed through the link as well. You may add this effect
to as an existing spirit link spell as well by using channel divinity, so long as you were the one who
cast it.

#### Cleanse Spirit
Starting at 6th level, you may use an action to cast the dispel magic spell (spell level equal to the highest spell level you can access) to any creature within 30 feet, but not on objects, areas, or creatures without spirits (such as Undead or Constructs). This may be used a number of times equal to your Spirit modifier (minimum 1). You may spend three uses of this ability to cast the remove curse spell instead with the same limitations. All expended uses are replenished at a long rest. To unwilling targets, this must be a ranged spell attack.

\pagebreakNum

Also, whenever you dispel any number of magical effects, you may choose to apply one of the
following additional effects:

* Allow the target to spend a hit dice to heal themselves
* Deal 1d6 points of arcane damage for each spell level removed
* Reduce the target‘s speed by 10 feet for 1 minute

#### Deep Healing
Starting at 8th level, your healing spells heal much more if the target is already
wounded. If the target of one of your shaman healing spells is bloodied, the benefits of your
Ancestral Blessing ability is doubled (double your Spirit modifier in extra hit points). If the target is
at 0 hit points and is unstable, the benefits triple.

Also, so long as one of your shaman totems is within 30 feet of you, you can cast any shaman
healing spell through it as if you were standing in its space. You can ‗chain‘ the shaman totem,
extending healing via the totems you prepare.

#### Totem Mastery
Starting at 17th level, you may activate two totems with the same reaction. You
may also include totems in the spirit link spell or effect, despite them being objects and not
creatures. For this purpose, they have resistance against any damage shared through the link,
soaking up the total damage distributed.

Also, whenever one of your totems is attacked (and not necessarily hit), it can move 10 feet in any
direction. If it ends adjacent to an ally, the totem regains 2d6 hit points.

## Tinker (TNK)
*A dwarf holds out his rifle, standing watch over his position
atop defensive walls. In the distance, he hears the explosion
in a mine. Mentally calculating the distance, he turns to a
nearby mortar, adjusting a few settings. He pulls the primer,
smirking as the mortar lobs the explosive shell somewhere
into the woods behind cover, releasing panicked screams
and another blast.*
<br><br>
*A large mechanical construct with arms of steel and razorsharp claws approaches a keep‘s shut portcullis. The
construct digs its claws under the steel of the gate, and
begins pulling it upwards, as a small voice from inside the
construct urges its fellows to pass quickly. From the walls, an
arrow clangs on the construct‘s shoulder, causing the driver
of the mecha to turn, lift an arm, and release a rocket barrage against the hapless archer. From
within, a gnome squeaks out an apology.*
<br><br>
*The goblin‘s green skin seems almost black from the soot of her explosives as she ducks behind the
ruined door frame, evading sling bullets and bolts of frost. She rests her back on the wall for a
moment, and unhooks a mechanical wheel from her back. She revs up a rip-tire, packs a few pieces
of dynamite into it, and releases it. With a roar, the wheel charges into the open gateway and lets
out a resounding blast. The goblin then smirks at the silence, and hearing a groan, she pulls out her
flamethrower, and moves in to clean up.*

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:570px;"></div>

For the tinker, innovation is both the tool and the end. Having the brain and the tools give them
the nearly limitless capacity to solve any problem. These engineers are lightly armored, and are
proficient with the skills to create a variety of tools and machines to help them achieve their goals.

### Consummate Innovators
Tinkers among the smartest and most creative of the adventurers setting out to explore and
conquer Azeroth. As a creator of incredible inventions from steam saws to siege engines, your
devices allow them to overcome nearly any situation — and if you don‘t have the device they need,
you just might be able to design and create a new one on the spot.

Tinkers are born of necessity—economic or military. Many gnomish and goblin engineers chose to
take up the path of the tinker because of its demand in peace and wartime, and to satisfy their
creativity. Tinkers tend to carry about packs and pouches full of heavy tools, spare parts and
inventions both finished and incomplete. In doing so, they quickly develop the ability to shoulder
casually otherwise crushing burdens. Furthermore, the tinker‘s ability to put together devices out of
random piles of spare parts or whatever wires and gears they happen to be carrying is a valuable
asset, allowing a tinker to address problems and improvise even when they would otherwise be
stumped.

\pagebreakNum

From developing vehicles such as the zeppelin or the steam engine to reliable weapons and
explosives, tinkers are increasingly needed innovators in the changing World of Warcraft.

### Adaptable Combatants
Tinkers prefer to spend days, weeks or even months constructing the devices they design. When
adventuring, though, tinkers are often forced to throw together a device more quickly or adapt
pieces of fallen technology to their purposes. A tinker can arrive onto a battlefield with many tools,
ranging from firearms, explosives, strange gadgets, to even personal vehicles and mecha. A tinker
always balances what they can bring with what they should bring, as relying on technology that is too
young could result in a crisis like the destruction of Gnomregan. They also look forward to
repurposing enemy technology, and a tinker‘s strength can grow the more developed their
opposition is.

Tinkers have a reputation for being dangerous companions before specializing, born mainly of
reckless goblins experimenting with explosives, or using gadgets made and owned by others.
However, the true heart of the tinker profession can be found in the steady craftsmanship of the
dwarves and the wild-eyed curiosity of the gnomes.

### Creating a Tinker
When you create a tinker, consider where you learned your craft. Are you self-taught or a student of
a well-established guild, university, or master tinker? How has that affected your starting devices and
formulae? Another thing to consider is your specialty—many gnomes and draenei prefer to rely on
gadgets, while goblins lean towards explosives, and dwarves would swear on a reliable firearm.

Are the components and parts of your devices usually supplied and numbered or scavenged and
repurposed from other devices?

Do you have qualms of repurposing technology (seeing it as a mark of poverty) or revel in it (seeing
it as a proof of your power and skill)? Have you ever worked for an engineering society or guild—
how have they treated you or used your inventions?

#### Quick Build
You can make a tinker quickly by following these suggestions. First. Intelligence should be your
highest ability score. Make Agility your next-highest if you want to excel at using firearms and
explosives. Choose Stamina or Strength instead if you plan to emphasize using constructs and
mecha. Second, choose the guild artisan background. Third, choose the following starting devices
in your engineer‘s notebook: boomstick (or auto-crossbow), fog machine (gadget), flamethrower
(gadget), and hand grenade (or iron rockets, iron bombs, or iron mines).

### Class Features
As a tinker, you have the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per tinker level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Stamina modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Stamina modifier per tinker level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** Light armor
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, maces, firearms, explosives, and short swords.
- **Tools:** Thieves‘ tools and Engineer‘s Tools
___
- **Saving Throws:** Agility, Intelligence
- **Skills:** Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception,
  Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (a) A mace or (b) a shortsword
- (a) 2 common explosives (your choice of the following: iron bomb, iron mine, or iron rocket)
- (a) A dungeoneer‘s pack, or (b) an explorer‘s pack
- Leather armor, Engineer‘s Tools
- Engineer‘s notebook, 250 gp worth of engineering materials (can be spent during charactercreation), and fuel enough for 4 devices charges of the tinker‘s choice (except alchemical fuel)

\pagebreakNum

#### Engineering
Starting when you gain your first level in this class, you are a master of engineering in the making.

You gain an engineer‘s notebook and can perform marvels with the skill that few can even imagine.

#### Notebook
At 1st level, your notebook contains four blueprints of your choice that detail the specifications of
any device you can create. When you level up, you gain 2 additional blueprints of your choice. You
may also acquire new blueprints by research, tutelage, or from the notebooks and blueprints of
tinkers who have devices you can create.

#### Innovation
You also gain the ability to craft temporary and unstable technological creations at certain levels.

Such creations have limitations compared to normal crafting (as described in Chapter 7), but are
more accessible and useable in combat. You also need the required tools at hand (Engineer's
Tools).

Creating temporary technological device costs an Action if a Consumable, 3 turns if a use-item
(such as a firearm), or 1 minute if a Creature (such as turret or combat armor).

| Level | Rarity | Point Cost<sup>1</sup> | Material Cost<sup>2</sup>
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Common | 5 | 1 gp<sup>3</sup>
| 1 | Uncommon | 7 | 4 gp
| 5 | Rare | 9 | 16 gp
| 9 | Epic | 11 | 64 gp
| 13 | Legendary | 13 | 256 gp
| 17 | Artifact | 15 | 1,024 gp

1 You reduce the crafting point cost by your proficiency bonus. You may reduce the point cost by
your proficiency bonus (not applied above). Common items can have their point cost reduced to 0.

2 The crafting cost is unaffected by the Efficient Alchemy feature. Unlike normal crafting, the base
crafting cost in materials is not modified for crafting class (x25 for Creatures), and thus innovating
a Consumable costs the same as a Creature.

3 Starting at 5th level, your Common-level temporary creations do not consume crafting materials,
but still require access to your tools (Engineer's Tools).

##### Crafting Point Cost
Your ability to do such rapid and innovative creations strains your mind and creative capabilities.

You are afforded a pool of Crafting Points (which act as Mana Points). Similarly to Mana Points,
you spend points to spontaneously craft items, and regain such points by resting. This is subject to
the following points of difference, however:
* You have a number of Crafting Points equal to your Intelligence score (not modifier) plus
  your proficiency bonus plus one-half your Tinker level (round down). Unlike mana points, your
  pool is unaffected by the spell level you can access. As this power is not magical in nature, you are
  unaffected by any anti-magic effects such as an antimagic field or mana burn effects.
* You do not regain points by mana-restorative effects, such as Mana Potions or resting near
  mana fountains. However, so long as you are in a relevant resource node or crafting area (such as
  an engineering workshop or your stronghold), you regain points with a +50% increase, as you draw
  inspiration from them.
* Your creation costs scale by the item‘s rarity and your ability to craft them; and are thus
  limited by the Rarity column in your class chart. You can craft anything you have memorized or if
  you refer to the formula of in your possession (such as in your formulae book).
___

A temporary creation that breaks down, fails, or expires can be harvested for one-half the crafting
materials invested. This does not apply to Consumables that were successfully used.

Your temporary creations can be made permanent by paying the rest of the crafting cost.

##### Material Cost
As well as consuming Crafting Points, temporary creations also cost material costs appropriate to
their rarity, as detailed above.

##### Temporary Item Duration
Once created, the temporary item remains until used (if a Consumable), until it breaks down (if a
Use-Item or Creature), or up to 5 minutes. Temporary creations are not stable, and if the item is
not a consumable in nature, you must succeed on a tool check (Engineer's Tools) against a DC of
15 after a successful use (if a Use-Item), 1 minute (if a Creature), or the creation breaks down.

If the item is not being used by you (or a creature bound to you), it has a +4 increase to its
malfunction rate. You may maintain multiple temporary creations, but they all begin expiring
starting from the round they were crafted.

##### At Higher Levels
As you increase in levels, creations of certain rarity require less time and effort. The time it takes for
you to innovate or craft temporary versions of your creations is reduced to a Bonus Action or 3
turns at the following levels for each rarity.

| Level | Rarity | Consumable | Use-Item | Creature
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 2nd | Common | Bonus Action | 1 turn | 3 turns
| 9th | Uncommon | Bonus Action | 1 turn | 3 turns
| 17th | Rare | Bonus Action | 1 turn | 3 turns

#### Patent
Also starting at 1st level, you gain increased mastery over a single engineered device of your creation
that is not a consumable. Your Patented device does not malfunction when being used.

Furthermore, if a construct or gadget, it takes one-quarter the fuel as normally required for a single
use. This stacks with the reduction for certain devices (such as strike effect gadgets).

The device may malfunction condition from other circumstances or abilities. This bonus only
applies to your Patent device, and does not extend to Innovated devices (even if they are of your
Patented device).

\pagebreakNum

#### Knack for It
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to make an Agility (Sleight of Hand) check or
use your Thieves‘ Tools to disarm a trap or open a lock.

Furthermore, you can choose to lower the malfunction rating of all devices you create by 2 points
(minimum 1).

#### Efficient Engineering
Starting at 2nd level, your ability to whip up devices increases your efficiency in creating normal
devices. You reduce the base crafting cost for technological devices from one-half to one-quarter
buying price. This does not affect the costs of material components for spells nor does it affect the
crafting costs for your Innovation ability. Normally crafting a device is also one step of complexity
faster. This does not also reduce the cost of spell material components.

Starting at 15th level, this ability also halves the cost of spell material components for your gadget
devices.

#### Tinker Path
At 3rd level, you choose a path that you emulate in the exercise of your tinker abilities: Bomber
who focuses on creating explosives, the Gunner who focuses on creating and shooting with
firearms, and Gadgeteer who focuses on creating wondrous gadgets, all detailed at the end of the
class description.

Your path choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

#### Flash Bomber
Also starting at 3rd level, you also gain the Flash Bomber talent, but may only use it for explosives.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Favored Creations
Starting at 5th level, you gain increased proficiency in innovation. Choose up to four devices.

These devices have half the Crafting Point cost, and their formulae are memorized. You may
change a single favored creation with one week of downtime.

#### Superfunction
Also starting at 5th level, your genius allows you to use malfunction rates to your benefit.

Whenever you use a device, there is a chance it performs unexpectedly well—thus the greater the
malfunction rate, the greater the superfunction rate. A Superfunction can stack with a critical hit (if
using a weapon-based engineered device).
<br><br>
**Superfunction Rate** = 20 – Malfunction Rate

For instance, an explosive that has a malfunction rate of 2 has a Superfunction rate of 18-20.

When a device superfunctions, it does not roll for a malfunction for the duration of the effect (see
below, affected by energy source). It also gains a bonus depending on its energy source. Choose one
benefit the device qualifies for.
* *Better.* The next malfunction condition is negated, and the next use of the device consumes no
  fuel charges (so long as it doesn‘t have only one use)
* *Faster.* The device gains a 25% increase in movement speed (if a construct or vehicle) for 1 hour
* *Harder.* The device cannot lose charges by taking damage or suffer any negative effects that
  would normally cause it to loses charges (such as overcharging) for 1 hour
* *Stronger.* The device deals maximum damage (no need to roll) with the next (or current) damage
  roll it makes
___
*Note.* Since your Patent device cannot malfunction, it can only Superfunction at a natural 20 use.

#### Coolness under Fire
Starting at 7th level, you may spend 4 Crafting Points to take 10 on any attack roll with an
engineered device or ability check with Engineer‘s Tools.

#### Consistent Innovations
Starting from 9th level, you have advantage to any tool check to maintain an innovated device, and
the maximum duration increases from 5 minutes to 1 hour. You lessen the malfunction rate of
innovated devices by 2 points (to a base increase of only 2 points). Without this ability, the malfunction rate is increased by 4 points.

#### Scavenge
Starting at 10th level, when you gather raw materials for use with engineering, you gain triple the
total value. This applies when harvesting existing devices, nodes, creatures, and deconstructing
devices. If dismantling an item, this cannot exceed one-half the value of creating the item itself
(counting any reductions).

#### Evasion
Also starting at 11th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red
dragon‘s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
make an Agility saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed
on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. You regain 2 Crafting Points if you suffer no
damage from a successful saving throw. If you make a saving throw versus an effect made by you,
you can either take half damage automatically or make a saving throw. If you choose to make a
saving throw, you take no damage on a successful save, but take normal (full) damage on a failed
save. After gaining 2 Crafting Points, you cannot gain more unless you complete a short rest.

#### Works as Intended
Starting at 11th level, you may spend 2 Crafting Points to remove the Malfunctioned condition of a
device you are touching. This costs a bonus action or reaction.

Also, removing the Malfunctioned condition requires 2d4 minutes instead of 1 hour (or the end of
a short rest).

In both cases, this does not require you being familiar with the device.

#### Battle-Tested
Starting from 13th level, your innovated creations that have been used at least three times without
breaking down can be kept unused indefinitely (instead of breaking down after 5 minutes).

If you choose to make the item into a permanent creation, you must pay the normal crafting cost,
but the item‘s malfunction rate is 1 point lower (minimum 0). This improved model can be shared
and scribed down as a new innovation. You cannot battle-test a base design more than once.

\pagebreakNum

You may also deal double damage to objects and constructs with your melee attacks as a strike
effect.
___
*Special.* For the purposes of the Superfunction ability, battle-tested creations act as if its malfunction
rate is 1 point higher instead of 1 point lower.

#### Quick Tech
Also starting at 15th level, you may use your innovate ability on a device of equal rarity, and
permanently alter the properties of the device. This device does not have to be built by you, nor
does it have to be temporarily-created. This costs the same number of Crafting Points as well as the
same time.

#### Shutdown
Starting at 17th level, you may expend 2 Crafting Points and a bonus action to increase the
malfunction rate of any device within 10 feet of you by 5 points for up to 1 hour. You can target
your own devices to increase the risk of malfunction and Superfunction (up to a 50% chance for
either). If you attempt to apply this feature to another device while it is active, its benefits end for
the previous one.

#### Precision Guesswork
Starting at 18th level, you spend half the required Crafting Points for the Coolness under Fire,
Works as Intended, and Shutdown abilities.

#### Engineering Mastery
Starting at 20th level, you may identify the weaknesses and command triggers for any device you
see. You gain the ability to deduce the operation and design of any device you operate or have one
hour to study, and have a 20% chance to recreate it from memory.

You can also spend a reaction if hit by a weapon attack made from a construct, trap, or engineered
device (except firearms and crossbows) to halve the amount of damage you take from it. This does
not stack with the bonus from your Evasion ability.

<div style="margin-top:500px;"></div>

### Bomber
You appreciate the controlled destruction behind a bomb, terrible surprise beneath a mine, and the
terror a rocket invokes. Bomber tinkers often makes use of mortars and rocket or mine launchers,
to deny enemy mobility as well as to deal massive damage to their enemies. Bombers are also
known as grenadiers, and often take to the skies on gyrocopters to unleash their fury from above.

#### Explosive Mastery
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you increase the range of
your bombs and rockets by 15 feet, and the range of your mine‘s detection to its blast radius
(beyond its actual position).

Also, any explosive you use is automatically modified by the Careful Explosion modification, with
no cost to the modification. If you roll a careen on mishap with an explosive, you may roll twice and
choose the second result (even if it‘s worse).

#### Corner Blast Strike
Starting at 6th level, whenever you use an explosive, you may center it against
one creature in the area of effect, dealing two additional dice of damage. This is a strike effect that
can target only one creature within the blast. If the explosive already affects only a single creature
(either by design or by fact), this is applied automatically without using a bonus action.

You also gain the mortar, rocket launcher, cluster launcher and mine launcher blueprints for no cost, and
they consume half the normal fuel.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:520px;"></div>

#### Greater Flash Bomber
Starting at 10th level, you can use the Flash Bomber talent a number of times equal to double your Intelligence modifier before a rest.

You also gain the remote blueprint for free if you didn’t already have it, and may employ it to trigger any number of your explosives normally, and can use it with a reaction.

#### Explosive Resistance
Starting at 14th level, you gain resistance to concussive, thunder, and
bludgeoning damage.

Also, whenever you are in the area of concussive damage or the blast radius of an explosion, you
can ‗ride the blast‘ and move up to one-half your speed away from the center of the blast, even if
you otherwise took no damage from it (such as by using the Evasion ability). This can propel you
upward if the explosion takes place under you. This distance is added to the distance the explosion
already moves you (if possible).

### Gunner
You are not only a renowned gunsmith, but is also an excellent marksman. Gunners are often
called gunslingers or musketeers, and are usually employed in battlefields.

#### Quick Reload
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you may use a bonus action to
reload a firearm instead of an action.

If you perform the Touch-Blast Strike special attack or attack with your firearm as a melee attack,
you can also reload as part of the action, and you may add your proficiency bonus to attacks with
firearms without bayonets. If you use a bayonet, you deal 2 extra points of damage with melee
attacks with them.

#### Special Bullets
Starting at 6th level, you gain the Suffused Arrows talent (gaining proficiency as
appropriate), and can create special infused bullets. You also deal 3 extra points of damage with any
unmodified bullets.

#### Practiced Precision
Starting at 10th level, you do not take disadvantage to your ranged attack roll
while being within 5 feet of a hostile creature, even if you don‘t attack them in melee first.

You also gain the Sharpshooter feat for free. If you already had it, you gain the Archery fighting
style (applicable to firearms only).

#### Firearm Improvement
Starting at 14th level, firearms you create always benefit from one free
modification (equivalent to 1 EP point), chosen from any modification that applies to firearms.
Also, whenever you apply an add-on to your firearms and suffer a malfunction, you can choose to
let only the add-on suffer the condition.

<div style="margin-top:500px;"></div>

### Gadgeteer
You appreciate the versatility gadgets provide, or prefer to craft and control constructs such as
mechs and vehicles of all types. Gadgeteers are often the drivers of their own devices, such as the
engines of goblin balloons, dwarf steam tanks, or gnomish submarines and gyrocopters.

#### Quick Cooldown
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your gadgets and
constructs always benefit from the Quick Use and Quick Startup modifications, respectively. This
has no cost.

#### Extensive Designing
Starting at 6th level, whenever you apply the Quick Use modification to your
devices (as described under Quick Cooldown above), you reduce it by a further step.
* Gadgets that replicate spell levels above 3rd level have their cooldown reduced to 1 minute
  instead of 1 hour.
* Gadgets that replicate spell levels above 6th level have their cooldown reduced to 1 hour
  instead of 8 hours.
___
You may also add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with your constructs.

#### Solid Engineering
Starting at 10th level, your devices do not lose charges when they are damaged,
and all your devices (except bombs and firearms) consume half the normal fuel (this may stack with
the Efficient Fuel modification).

Also, you memorize the formula for phlogiston, gaining proficiency in Alchemist‘s Supplies if you
don‘t already have it.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:500px;"></div>

#### Protective Shell
Starting at 14th level, all your constructs always benefit from the Coated Interior
and Efficient Fuel modifications (for a total fuel reduction of 1/8 the normal cost for constructs).

You may also add double the Construct‘s Challenge Rating to its maximum hit points.

Also, whenever you activate a gadget that requires a harness or concentration, you gain temporary
hit points equal to 1d10 + your Tinker level, which remain until the gadget stops operating. This
does not stack with the benefit of the Coated Interior modification.

## Warlock (WRK)
*Her hand waving playfully around the mana wyrm, a
blood elf soothes the critter. In an instant, the wyrm‘s
calm nature turns to anguish, as the elf‘s eyes turn
green and the beast‘s essence is drawn towards her.
Nothing is left but a glowing orb of raw mana
between the elf‘s fingers.*
<br><br>
*The earth beneath the orc‘s feet decaying, the grass
dying. An infernal nears the orc, waiting patiently for
his master‘s command. Impatiently, the infernal
screeches, causing even the orc to wince with fear, as
the demon‘s master grins from the shadows beyond.*
<br><br>
*Murlocs advance upon the forsaken limping through the swamp. Without breaking his stride, he
waves his hand behind him, engulfing the murlocs in flame. He marches on, scourging whoever
stands in his way.*
<br><br>
Warlocks are magical practitioners that seek to understand darker, fel-based magics, including
destructive spells. While many warlocks willingly follow the Burning Legion, there are those who
work against it, using their magic to fight against evil. Warlocks have proven themselves to be
powerful allies - as well as powerful foes.

In the face of demonic power, most heroes see death. Warlocks see only opportunity. Dominance is
their aim, and they have found a path to it in the dark arts. These voracious spellcasters summon
demonic minions to fight beside them. Warlocks can ignite distant enemies in searing flame, send
them fleeing in terror and pain, or afflict them with corrupting diseases and curses that steal the
victim‘s vitality.

### Forbidden Mysteries
Born of trafficking with fel magic, warlocks are absolutely corrupt and unimaginably powerful.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

Their chaos magics have burnt out whole worlds and annihilated countless species over the eons.

The Eredar lord Kil'jaeden taught the orcs the secrets of warlock magics, but the orcs could never
master the powers of entropy and destruction as well the wicked Eredar. Under Archimonde's
command, the warlocks serve as the Legion's tacticians and strategists.

Warlocks peer into the Void without hesitation, leveraging the chaos they glimpse within to
devastating ends in battle—their greatest abilities are fueled by the souls they‘ve harvested from their
victims. They exploit powerful Shadow magic to manipulate and degrade the minds and bodies of
their enemies. They employ Fire magic, dropping hellish rain from the sky, to immolate the
opposition. They summon and command otherwise indomitable demons from the Twisting Nether
to do their bidding, or even to be sacrificed as the Warlock sees fit, protecting the dark caster from
harm.

These practitioners of the profane are feared across Azeroth, and many who have felt their wrath
now prefer to fight alongside a warlock than against one. Warlocks are common in both the
Alliance and Horde, though in most cases they serve the Burning Legion while disguising their true
loyalties.

### Conjuring and Binding
Warlocks are the most volatile and insatiable of spellcasters. Though they often pledge themselves
to the service of noble causes and are not innately evil, their desire to understand darker magics
and exercise unwavering command over demonic forces breeds mistrust among even their closest
allies.

These dark casters burn and destroy weakened foes with a combination of crippling illnesses and
dark magic. While their demon pets protect and enhance them, warlocks strike at their enemies
from a distance. As physically weak

\pagebreakNum

spellcasters bereft of heavy armor, cunning warlocks allow their
minions to take the brunt of enemy attacks in order to save their own skin.

### Creating a Warlock
Warlocks are arcane spellcasters who study dark arts and magics associated with demons and the
Burning Legion. Due to this, they gain a very deeply tainted reputation due to their tendencies to
traffic and deal with demons. Hiding in cellars and secret covens, warlocks are known for making
secret pacts for permanent demonic companions that grow steadily in power so long as the warlock
does.

Warlocks are common in both the Alliance and Horde, though in most cases they serve the
Burning Legion while disguising their true loyalties.

When creating your warlock character, think about what led you to take up the powers of evil. Did
you decide to beat the forces of evil at their own game? Were you seduced by dark forces? Do you
view the fel as truly evil?

However you chose to follow the path of power, think about what implications it has on your
character, and how they are perceived by greater society. Most warlocks are shunned, and live as
pariahs—you could be a highly charismatic character, hiding your true talent for the dark arts,
however, or might be justifying it to your followers and loved ones as fighting fire with fire.

#### Quick Build
You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your
highest ability score, followed by Stamina. Second, choose the charlatan background. Second,

</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Eredun
You know Eredun, the language of fiends and the Burning Legion. You can speak the language,
and do not suffer any penalty from its curse. If you can speak Eredun, you can communicate with
all other warlocks and fiends, even if you don‘t otherwise share a language.

However, you are (due to demonic promises) often more likely than others to seek out pacts
willingly.

#### Demonic Studies
Starting at 1st level, the warlock is also initiated into a warlock circle. You may choose a demonic
study, which describes the way you take to power. You can choose Affliction, the path of the
withering magical casters, Demonology, who focus on their demonic allies and improving them, or
Destruction, who summons Hellfire upon their foes. Your choice grants you features when you
choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

#### Demonic Invocation
Starting at 1st level, you may rapidly recover your mana by invoking demonic energies. You can use your action and bonus action on your turn to regain up to 20 mana points.

You replenish your reserve of demonic power when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, fel energies suffuse you, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting you advantage to saving throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

#### Spellcasting
Also starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to cast spells, trafficking in demonic forces most have
no hope of understanding or controlling. You have a grimoire containing spells that show the first
glimmerings of your true power.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A warlock can conjure and bind aberrations, elementals, fiends, oozes, and undead.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each warlock level provides you with 1 caster level in the warlock class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section). You prepare the list of
warlock spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the warlock spell list.

Preparing a new list of warlock spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute per spell level
for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, since you strengthen your magic by
summoning and tapping into extraplanar beings.

You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making
an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier

\columnbreak

##### Spellbook – Grimoire
At 1st level, your grimoire contains six 1st-level warlock spells of your choice. When you level up,
you gain 2 additional warlock spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research,
tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your grimoire is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by scribing in new spells or your
insights regarding the planes and the powers you serve.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

#### Soul Shards
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep and mysterious magic of souls. This wellspring is represented by
soul shards, which allow you to weaken your enemies or strengthen your own spells, by siphoning
off a part of the opponent‘s lifeforce.

#### Soul Shards
Your magic can bind your opponent‘s lifeforce to your own. Whenever you deal damage by a spell,
melee or ranged weapon or spell attack, or whenever a creature you summoned or bound deals
damage to a creature that is not a construct, they are marked by your warlock magic until the
beginning of your turn in the next round.

If the creature dies or is reduced to 0 hit points while marked this way, you gain a soul shard. A
creature cannot be marked by more than one warlock at a given time. Any new mark replaces the
one before it, unless the previous mark was placed by a warlock of higher level.

You can have a maximum number of soul shards equal to your Warlock level. Soul shards fade at a
rate of 1 shard per hour (or 1 shard per short rest) if not used. The creature must be a qualifying
threat to you (such as by having a Challenge comparable with your level, or if it is able to reliably or
consistently harm you).

You may use soul shards for any of the following:
* *Enhanced Conjuring:* You may spend one soul shard per spell level, and quicken any conjure
  spell of a casting time of 1 minute to cost only a 1 action. For until the beginning of your
  turn in the next round, your speed is 0.

* *Enhanced Concentration:* When you cast a conjuration warlock spell that requires
  concentration, you may spend one soul shard to concentrate on the spell, instead of having
  to concentrate on it yourself. You cannot concentrate on more than two conjured creatures
  using this ability. When your concentration is threatened, you must roll to maintain both
  spells, however. This costs one soul shard per spell level.

* *Soul Magic:* With a bonus action, you can force a living creature or an undead to take -4 to
  its saving throw of one of your warlock spells, or you can gain a +4 bonus to your own spell
  and attack rolls to such targets (including sigil rolls). This functions up to 5th level spells,
  and costs one soul shard per spell level. This bonus can be applied after knowing the result
  of the roll (whether failure or success).

#### Warlock Focus
At 3rd level, you may choose to focus on one of two warlock focuses.

\pagebreakNum

* *Fiendish Alliance:* The warlock gains a permanent bound companion that accompanies you
  on your adventures, advises you in the ways of demonology, and teaches you magical spells
  upon the completion of tasks (determined by the DM). You can also have the conjure fiend
  spell memorized. See Bound Companion for details.
* *Shadow Harvest:* You gain the ability to reap soul shards out of your victims. As a bonus
  action you can target one hostile creature within 60 feet of you, and shearing its soul. This
  deals 1d4 points of shadow damage for each spell level you access and grants you a number
  of soul shards equal your proficiency bonus. Once you use this power, you cannot use it
  again until you complete a short or long rest. If the target dies from using this power, roll a
  d6. On a result of 5-6, you do not expend this power.
___
The companion you gain by the Fiendish Alliance focus must be a demon you can summon and
bind to your service (see the bind spell) that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge
rating equal to the highest-level demon you can bind spell. See Bound Companion and the bind
spell for more details.

##### Bond
When a fiend you are bound to is reduced to 0 hit points, you may transfer to them your own hit
points as a reaction, so long as you are within 10 feet of them. You may only transfer enough hit
points to leave them at 1 hit point.

If the bound fiend is killed, you must succeed against a DC 20 Stamina saving throw or suffer 1d10
arcane damage per Challenge of the demon, as its life-force is torn from yours. As the fiend is dead,
you must bond with another.

##### Leveling up
The level of the fiend is equal to the highest-level demon you can bind with the warlock‘s Bind
Fiend spell.

##### Special
Bonding with a fiend requires spending one hour communicating with the creature, and spending
the next seven hours in activities the fiend considers to be ‗bonding‘, such as arson for imps,
bloodshed for felguards, as the DM decides.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Fiendish Barter
Starting on 10th level, you can generate soul shards momentarily at the expense of future access to
them. You may use your Action and gain a number of soul shards equal to half your Warlock level
(up to your normal maximum).

Until you complete a short rest, any soul shards you gain after using this ability are deduced from
the number of soul shards you gained by Fiendish Barter, plus another 2 Soul Shards. Once used,
you cannot use this ability again until you complete a short rest.

#### Soul Vault
When you reach 20th level, you may gain two soul shards instead of one per every enemy reduced
to 0 hit points as a result of your warlock spells.

Also, you may stow your grimoire into the pocket realm (known as the soul vault) of your choosing
by using 3 soul shards, and can draw it out using 1 soul shard. You do not need to physically
possess the grimoire at that time, but must be within 100 feet of it, and spend 1 action to banish it
into the realm or draw it back again.

Only you can access the pocket realm, unless you choose a realm that multiple creatures can enter
(in which case, you can designate the grimoire to appear at any point you previously conducted a 1-
hour ritual to attune the book to the place).

#### Demonic Studies
An Azerothian warlock may choose one of the three below archetypes.

\pagebreakNum

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

### Affliction
Your mastery over sigil spells corrupts and destroys your enemies. Affliction warlocks are feared
exemplars of the art.

#### Haunt
Starting at 1st level, you gain the Mystic Blast feat, but must choose to deal fel damage.

When casting a damaging sigil spell, you may use a single soul shard to also use your make a Mystic
Blast attack against the same target as a bonus action. This still requires a ranged spell attack, but
the range of the mystic blast becomes equal to the range of the sigil spell.

Furthermore, whenever a creature dies while under the effect of a warlock sigil you cast, you gain a
soul shard. This can stack with the soul shard you gain from landing a killing blow.

#### Infestation
Also starting at 1st level, you may use a soul shard to refresh the duration of a current
sigil effect, or to automatically succeed on maintaining a sigil effect.

A single creature cannot be affected by this more than once in the same 24 hours period.

#### Soul Swap
Starting at 6th level, you may alter the target of a sigil spell effect as a bonus action,
targeting any eligible target within a range equal to the spell‘s original range. The spell‘s effects take
place at the new target‘s turn as usual.

If you are under the effects of the avatar form warlock spell and you choose to alter the target of the
sigil spell with this ability, you may attempt a sigil roll on your original target before shifting the
spell (possibly affecting two targets in the same turn).

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

#### Seed of Corruption
Starting at 14th level, if you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a damaging
sigil or single-target channel spell effect, you may produce one of the following effects:
* *Exploding Seed.* You may deal the sigil (or channel) damage again in a 30-foot burst. This
  does not count as an additional hit against the original target.
* *Store Seed.* You may recapture the spell‘s effects, regaining the spell. If you choose to do so,
  you can cast the spell again for no cost against another target within 1 minute. This acts as
  if you cast the spell again, for the purposes of actions required (but not for resources spent
  like mana or components), and for the purposes of talents that trigger off spell use (such as
  your Haunt talent). You can store one seed this way.

#### Corruptive Influence
Starting at 18th level, whenever you would fail to maintain a sigil effect, you
can either store the spell (as described in Seed of Corruption) or use your Soul Swap ability. You
can also store up to three spells using your Seed of Corruption ability, and you can store them for
up to 4 hours.

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

### Demonology
Your consorting with demons has been noticed and appreciated by the forces in the Twisting
Nether. A demonologist often adventures alone, relying on nobody other than himself and his
enslaved demons.

#### Blood Pact
Starting at 1st level, all demons summoned or bonded to you gain a bonus to their
maximum hit points as if you knew and used their true name (this may stack with actually knowing
their true names, see Chapter 10). You may also add your proficiency bonus to all your fiendish
allies‘ attack rolls and saving throws. This does not stack with their own proficiency bonuses.

#### Demonic Echoes
Also starting at 1st level, you may count demons as eligible targets for all
creature-specific spells by using a soul shard (such as charm person or hold elemental). You may at any
time grant your hit points to them as a reaction on their round, or a bonus action on your round.

You may also drain their hit points with the same action (at a 2:1 ratio), though you can only
benefit from drained hit points once every long rest.

Furthermore, you gain two soul shards instead of one if a demon under your control kills a
creature.

#### Fel Mind
Starting at 6th level, you can use the Enhanced Concentration ability without spending
Soul Shards.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

#### Dark Secrets
Starting at 14th level, you gain advantage to all saves versus spells, except those who
deal holy damage, and gain immunity to one elemental damage type. You may also use a soul shard
and a reaction to grant one demonic ally advantage to its first attack during a round, or impose
disadvantage to the attacker targeting it.

Furthermore, when you are under the effects of the avatar form warlock spell, you also gain
resistance to all damage taken by fiends and weapons (magical or otherwise) wielded by creatures of
evil alignment.

#### Demon-Soul
Starting at 18th level, whenever you summon a demonic creature by a spell or use
your fiendish alliance ability to bind a fiend (as per the Conjure or Bind Fiend spell), you may
summon or bind another fiend of the same or lower level (these are counted as if concentrating on
the same spell). Thus, you may summon a succubus and a felguard, or an imp and a felhound, or
two succubi or felguards and have them bound at the same time. Commanding both bound
creatures is the same concentration action.

When you are killed, your spirit is taken to an demiplane (see the spell) that is owned by you, where
you return to life in the matter of 1d10 days, nurtured by any demonic allies you have employed,
enslaved, or allied with.

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

### Destruction
You are a master of chaotic fel-fire, calling down the green flame to burn and demolish your foes.
Destruction warlocks usually take the Fiendish Power focus, eschewing an actual alliance with
demons over the awesome destructive power of fel magic.

#### Chaos Magic
Starting at 1st level, any fire or fel spell you use that deals damage also deals an
additional 1d6 points of the other type (fire deals extra 1d6 fel, or vice versa). Spells that deal both
fire and fel damage gain an additional 1d10 damage from either types (your choice). This triggers
once per spell.

#### Havoc
Also at 1st level, you gain the Havoc ability, and can spend a soul shard to activate it.
* *Havoc:* You may spend one soul shard to affect two creatures within 30 feet of one another
  with a single-target damaging or channeling (such inferno blast or drain mana), so long as the
  spell is from the warlock spell list. The spell cannot have a range of touch or self.
___
Maintaining the spell on one target maintains it on the other so long as the spell‘s duration
is active.

Furthermore, you also gain two soul shards instead of one if you reduce a creature to 0 hit points
with a channeled warlock spell.

#### Searing Magics
Starting at 6th level, you may also target a creature with an action to make it more susceptible to your fire and fel spells. If the target is immune to fire or fel, it becomes resistant to the damage. If it is resistant, it loses the resistance. If it has no resistance, it becomes vulnerable.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

If it was previously vulnerable, it takes triple damage. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until after a short rest (unless you used this ability while under the effects of the avatar form warlock spell, in which case you can use the ability twice).

#### Incinerate
Starting at 14th level, whenever you deal fire damage to an enemy with a spell (through
the spell or through your chaos magic ability), you may use a soul shard to manifest one of the
following effects. This triggers once per round.
* *Burning Blast.* If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, you can deal 6d6 damage (or the
  damage they took, whichever is lower) in a 30-foot burst centered on the target.
* *Lingering Brimfire.* The target suffers the burning condition for until the end of their turn in
  the next round. While suffering this condition and taking at least 1 point of damage in the
  same round, the target has disadvantage to attack rolls and ability checks.
* *Quickened Infestations.* Cast any sigil spell you have prepared without spending the normal
  casting time.

#### Soul Burner
Starting at 18th level, you double the range of your fire and fel spells. If the spell has
an area of effect, you may double the area of effect instead. Your Incinerate ability also does not
cost a soul shard.

## Warrior (WAR)
*The heavily-armored dwarf takes a deep breath, tightening his
grip on a war-hammer in one hand and a battleaxe in the other,
facing down the ogre warlord raiding his mountain home. The
mountain king shouts a battle-cry, suddenly increasing in size to
equal the ogre, and swings his axe to dig deeply into the ogre‘s
shoulder, before bringing down the war-hammer, causing a
bloody shower to erupt onto his face.*
<br><br>
*An orc armed with a great two-handed blade leaps towards two
naga, cleaving through both with a single strike and shaking the
ground where he fell. Not breaking a sweat, he charges ahead to
the next foe.*
<br><br>
*A tauren calmly strides across the fel-suffused battlefield, seeking a worthy opponent. Eventually, he
finds his match, a bloodthirsty felguard. Treading carefully, he parries every blow with his giant
battle-totem. Noticing an opportunity, the tauren warrior slams his hooves into the ground,
knocking the felguard down, and then bringing down his mighty totem down, caving the fiend‘s
torso inward with a furious war-cry.*
<br><br>
Warriors are fighters highly trained in the art of weaponry. Combat is the warrior's strongest skill.
They are strong and quick on the battlefield. Depending on their specialization, a warrior can often
deal very high damage or be tough to kill.

### Trained for Battle
As long as war is waged on Azeroth, there will be men and women who fight those wars. Warriors
are no mere sword-swingers; they are skilled combatants, combining strength of arm, knowledge of
weaponry, and practiced maneuvers to slice or bludgeon their foes into little red bits. Warriors are
the most versatile of the combat classes, and they supplement their fighting prowess with the ability
to rally their allies and spur them to victory. They charge into the

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

heart of the battle and survive the
most grievous of wounds. Elven and dwarven warriors reach into their blood for innate magic,
creating spellbreakers and mountain kings, respectively, while tauren and orcs lean naturally
towards using a single large weapon and the Arms path, creating chieftains and blademasters,
respectively.

Warriors are common in dwarf, forsaken, human, and orc societies, but many other species also fill
their ranks with warriors. Masters of swords, spears, and weapons of all kinds, warriors share a
common way of life on Azeroth. Using their abilities to deal pain and cause bloodshed, warriors are
deadly adversaries and welcome friends in violent times (which seem to be all the time in recent
decades). Anyone willing to take up arms to defend their people can be classed as a warrior. A
knight is the warrior elite among humans.

### Elite Fighters
Not every member of the city watch, village militia, or the queen‘s army is a warrior. Most of these
troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge or drilled for a
certain function. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and
similar figures are true warriors—it is all about the spirit, in truth.

Some warriors feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster
slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a warrior, not
all that different from the life he or she left behind. Other warriors live a more stable life, serving as
elite members in an order or military force, answering assignments and missions that involve armed
pacification of resistance or the escort of vulnerable charges.

\pagebreakNum

### Creating a Warrior
For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle.

Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in
glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies
support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage
at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons.

As you build your warrior, think about your character‘s background: Where did you get your
combat training, and what sets you apart from the mundane soldiers around you? You might have
enjoyed formal training in a noble‘s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self—taught—unpolished
but well tested.

Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, or did your spirit shine
brightly enough to warrant the title due to exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training
in the first place? Was it a threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself?
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a
proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been
military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your
armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between
you and death's embrace.

#### Quick Build
You can make a warrior quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Agility your
highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or
finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Stamina. Second, choose the soldier
background.

### Class Features
As a warrior, you gain the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per warrior level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Stamina modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Stamina modifier per warrior level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None

___
- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Stamina
- **Skills:** Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight,
  Intimidation, Perception, and Survival

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* chain mail or *(b)* leather, longbow, and 20 arrows
- *(a)* a martial weapon and a shield or *(b)* two martial weapons
- *(a)* a light crossbow and 20 bolts or *(b)* two handaxes
- *(a)* a dungeoneer‘s pack or *(b)* an explorer‘s pack

#### Special
Upon gaining your starting class proficiencies, you may lose proficiency with heavy armor, and instead gain the Unarmored Defense ability. These are not gained as part of multi-classing.

##### Unarmored Defense
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Agility modifier + your
Stamina modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

\pagebreakNum

#### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You
can‘t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
* **Archery.** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
* **Defense.** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling.** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting.** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
  wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a
  1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Protection.** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use
  your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting.** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
  second attack.

#### Warrior Talent
Starting at 1st level, you gain a class talent, representing your preferred tactics and adaptability on
the field of battle. See Class Talents at the end of the Chapter 3 for options.

Whenever you qualify for another talent (as detailed in the talent column), you can choose another
talent or gain another use of an existing talent.

#### Warrior Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and
techniques. Choose between the Arms Warrior, a champion in using great-weapons, the Fury
Warrior, who focuses on bleeding his enemies and debilitating them tactically, or the Protection
Warrior who focuses on defense while reflecting physical damage. All are detailed at the end of the
class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th,
15th, and 18th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and
to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

#### Warrior Archetypes
The warrior can choose from one of the below archetypes.

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

### Arms
You focus on wielding great weapons, breaking enemy lines, inflicting the first wounds in battle,
and dealing massive amounts of damage. As they cleave through several creatures at once to soften
up their foes for their allies, arms warriors become an inspiring sight on the battlefield, and are
masters of their chosen weapons.

#### First Blood
Starting upon gaining this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a +2 bonus to your melee attack and damage rolls so long as you are targeting a creature that does not have the Bloodied condition.

#### Cleaving Strike [Strike]
Also at 3rd level, when you successfully attack and damage a creature with a melee attack, you spend a bonus action to attack another creature you choose that is within 5 feet away from the first target. If you already have the Great Weapon Master feat, and if its conditions trigger, resolve the Great Weapon Mastery extra attack, and then the Cleaving Strike. Both use the same bonus action.

#### Master of Arms
Starting at 7th level, when you use a strike effect, you can apply it to all your melee attacks until the start of your turn in the next round with the same bonus action. Limited-use strike effects are still limited by their uses.

#### Mortal Strike [Strike]
Starting at 10th level, you may severely wound a creature’s healing capabilities if you successfully apply a mortal strike. If a creature is affected by a Mortal Strike, you deal 2 extra points of damage to them, and they must succeed on a Stamina saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength bonus or take 50% less healing from all sources for one minute.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

So long as a creature is affected this way, you may always apply your First Blood feature to the target (even if they do have the Bloodied condition). A creature cannot be affected by this ability more than once in 24 hours.

Mortal Strike can only be used with melee weapons.

#### Die by the Sword
Starting at 15th level, you are inspired by battlefield glories, and are able to react
quickly to attacks. Whenever a target within 5 feet of you makes a successful attack against you, you
gain a d6 Counterattack dice. You may spend the dice to make an attack as a reaction at any point
out of your turn so long as the target dealt damage to you in the last minute, and may add the
counterattack dice result to the total damage. Unlike with normal reactions, you may apply one
strike effect to this attack.

You can hold up to 3 Counterattack dice. They all fade within one minute if not consumed.

#### Overpower [Strike]
Starting at 18th level, you may, after successfully damaging an enemy with a
melee attack, regain hit points equal to double your Proficiency bonus. You may instead grant half
the benefit to any ally within 30 feet. This is a strike effect that costs a bonus action. The enemy
must be a qualifying threat to you for you to use this ability.

If the target of this strike was also successfully affected by your Mortal Strike feature, you gain
double the normal amount of hit points.

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

### Fury
You equip yourself with two weapons, and slice your enemies to ribbons while shouting vengeance.

Fury warriors make good party members, as inspiring shouts aid their allies.

#### Strike the Wound
Starting at 3rd level, you gain momentary clarity towards causing further
wounds after landing the first. If you make a successful melee attack roll against a target, your
weapon attack can score a critical hit on a lower result of the dice (on a natural 19 or 20 instead of
only 20). This effect stacks to a maximum roll of 17-20, and ends at the start of your turn in the
next round.

Also, you gain the Dual Wielder feat if you didn‘t already have it. If you already have it, you add +1
to your weapon damage rolls with either weapon.

#### Bloodthirst
Starting at 7th level, you may attack again if you miss a melee attack. This does not require
a separate action from the one used to make the attack. If you make use of this ability, the target is
not counted as if they were hit for the purposes of the Strike the Wound ability unless you also
successfully hit them. You may use this number of times equal to your Stamina modifier, which
replenishes upon completing a short or long rest.

Furthermore, if you miss an attack roll against an enemy, you are treated as if you successfully
landed a hit for the purposes of the Strike the Wound ability.

#### Battle Commands
Starting at 10th level, you gain the Shout talent for free (if you don‘t already
have it). Furthermore, whenever you attack with your off-hand weapon as a bonus action, you can
maintain a shout or apply one strike effect.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

#### Hellscream
Starting at 15th level, all hostile creatures within range of your shouts take Thunder
damage equal to half your level whenever you shout or maintain one. They are entitled a Stamina
saving throw to half damage contested by your own Stamina saving throw.

Also, your critical range for your Strike the Wound ability becomes 15-20.

#### Bloody Ribbons
Starting at 18th level, whenever you spend a Bonus Action to make an attack
with your off-hand weapon, you can instead make two attacks. Also, whenever you would gain an
action (such as by the haste spell or Action Surge ability), you double the attacks you can normally
make with your Bonus Action.

Bloody Ribbons expends a use of your Bloodthirst ability.

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

### Protection
You are the forward vanguard, decking yourself with heavy armors and a reliable shield. Protection
warriors deflect and guarding their allies from attacks, and return damage with interest.

#### Block and Tackle
Starting at 3rd level, you may use a reaction to block a weapon attack that hits
you, reducing the damage taken by 1d12 + your Stamina modifier. This requires a shield. If this
reduces the damage to 0 points, you may use the same reaction to attack the target with an
opportunity attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Stamina bonus
(minimum 2 uses). Once all uses are expended, they are restored after a short rest.

You may expend two uses of this ability and benefit an ally within 5 feet of you with this ability
instead of you, reducing the damage on them as described (and targeting whoever harmed them
with an opportunity attack). If whoever struck your ally is not within your melee range for the
opportunity attack, you may move up to 5 feet to deliver it.

#### Sundering Strike [Strike]
Starting at 7th level, you may sunder an enemy‘s armor, reducing their
AC by 1 point per strike (up to -5, but never below that of their AC if unarmored). This effect
remains until the armor is tended to with the appropriate artisans‘ tools and 1 hour of work.

This can be applied to natural armor. In this case, the AC is restored upon completing a short rest.

#### Vigilance
Starting at 10th level, your block and tackle ability blocks an additional 1d12 (for a total
of 2d12 + your Stamina modifier). Whenever you perform an opportunity attack derived from your
Block and Tackle ability, you can add one of the following effects.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

* *Destructive Counter.* Your opportunity attack deals an additional 2d6 damage.
* *Disarming Counter.* Your opportunity attack drops the enemy‘s weapon. If they reach for it
  while threatened by you, you can make another attack of opportunity.
* *Pushing Counter.* Your opportunity attack pushes the enemy 5 feet away.
* *Repositioning Counter.* Your opportunity attack allows you to exchange places with an ally
  within 5 feet of you.

#### Vanguard
Starting at 15th level, whenever you start your round in a turn with below half your
maximum hit points, and have no temporary hit points, you gain a number of temporary hit points
equal to 1d12 + your Stamina modifier.

#### Restored Strength
Starting at 18th level, you may use the Second Wind talent three times before
requiring rest. Furthermore, whenever you use Second Wind, you gain resistance to any damage
you take for one round after use, and advantage against any saving throw made against the first
spell that affects you in the next minute.

If you don‘t already have the Second Wind talent, you gain it as a talent instead of improving it.

<div style="margin-top:440px;"></div>

### Demon Hunter (Rogue)
Demon hunters are specialists in fighting demonic outsiders, and sacrifice both body and mind to
gain alien and terrifying powers. Although most commonly found amongst the Night Elves (with
the Night Elf Illidan Stormrage being the first known Demon Hunter) and the Illidari, the abilities
can be learned by many who fight demons, such as secretive high elven organizations, human
wizarding societies, or even draenei or orcish inquisitorial orders. Demon hunters typically utilize
warglaives for combat (see equipment).

Warlocks who turn against the Burning Legion may exchange their class to demon hunter on a 1:1
ratio, such as death knights or warlocks do with their previous classes of paladin or mage and
shaman (respectively). This still requires being blinded.

Rogues wishing to become demon hunters usually take the leap, favored enemy (fiends), and dread
ambusher talents.

#### Prerequisites
The demon hunter aspirant must be permanently blinded either by a spell, by a
demon, or via use of a Mana Blade (see Equipment). The demon hunter must also have performed
mana siphon against a demon.

#### Corruption
You may pledge your soul as well, turning yourself into a demonic creature (permanently gaining
the below Demonic Nature ability, and counting as the demonic creature type).

##### Demonic Nature
You don‘t require air, food, drink, or sleep. You are also immune to mundane
and nonmagical poisons and diseases, and have advantage to effects that cause the exhausted and
poisoned conditions.

You can also speak Eredun and cannot be corrupted by it, as if the warlock feature of the same
name.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

Also, a draenei who takes on the mantle of demon hunter may alter their Gift of the Naaru ability,
casting the mind blast spell instead, as the draenei takes on the psychic powers of the Eredar in
exchange of the holy powers of the Naaru. This extremely uncommon sacrifice also takes its toll on
the draenei‘s body, slowly morphing their appearance through extended exposure to fel magic to be
more like the Eredar or a Broken Draenei.

#### Demon Spellcasting
Drawing on fel magics not unlike those practiced by warlocks, you can cast
spells that are normally cast by warlocks. You cast all spells drawn from the warlock spell list.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each demon hunter level provides you with 0.5 a caster level in the Warlock class (1 at 3rd level).

You follow the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of Warlock spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Warlock
spell list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest by consulting your
spellbook. You otherwise follow the warlock‘s rules for spellbooks, conjuring, and binding,
however, most demon hunters inscribe their spells to their skin as tattoos rather than in grimoires,
using expensive inks and difficult techniques. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma.

\pagebreakNum

Also, after mana siphoning a fiend, your weapons are treated as magical for 8 hours, as the residual
fel energies are being used by you against the demons' defenses. If you ever kill a demon of CR 10
or above, any weapon you used for the deed can be treated as magical after 1 minute of focusing
your power on it. This effect is permanent, but only manifests when the weapon is used by you.

#### Suffused Sight
Also starting at 3rd level, you may choose to either gain Darkvision 60 feet (or
increase the range of existing darkvision by 60 feet), or gain the spectral sight ability.

#### Spectral Sight
Your sight is both enhanced and hindered. Within 100 feet, you have blindsight.

Beyond this range, your sight is hazy, colorless, and unclear, imposing disadvantage on Spirit
(Perception) checks. You can perceive certain things clearly (as if normal sight) regardless of
distance, such as the following: celestials, fiends, undead, and any creature with an active mana
pool. If a creature is disguised, you may roll a Spirit (Perception) check upon sight, and a successful
check yields to you that you sense strange powers nearby (though it does not readily point out who
without another ability check).

At will, you may concentrate your sight as an action, and cast the detect magic spell. The range of the
spell increases up to your blindsight range.

#### Dark Metamorphosis
Starting at 9th level, your suffusion with demonic power almost overwhelms
your original potential. You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn. Whenever you use a Bonus Action to attack with your offhand, you can make two
attacks as well instead of only one.

Furthermore, you gain the avatar form warlock spell for no cost if you didn‘t already have it, and
always have it prepared for no cost. Furthermore, you augment the spell in the following ways:
* You gain the benefits of the demon skin spell (spell level equal to the highest-level spell you
  can cast) for no cost.
* Your Strength and Charisma scores increases by 2 points (up to a maximum of 18 each).
* You gain wings, horns, and claws.
    * *Wings.* You can glide, and your jump distance is tripled (this can stack with the
      jump spell). For every 10 feet of distance you fall, you can glide 30 feet in any direction. You
      can also instead take no fall damage so long as you can exercise your wings.
      If you
      are restrained or otherwise encumbered, you cannot make use of your wings.
    * *Horns and Claws.* You gain a horn and claw attack as an unarmed strike. These are
      light melee weapon attacks that deal 1d6 piercing and 1d4 slashing damage
      (respectively, plus your Strength or Agility as normal). These weapons are also
      magical (with +1 to attack and damage rolls).
___
While your avatar form shape, you are treated as a fiend for all spell purposes (such as charm and
dominate spells). This is considered a shapeshifting effect.

You may choose one of the following features to remain in your normal form: wings, claws, or
horns.

The chosen feature remains indefinitely. You can retract claws (if you choose to keep them
indefinitely), but you cannot hide your wings (besides wrapping them around you as a cloak) or
horns. Upon 13th and 17th level, you can choose another feature to make permanent (in the end,
having wings, claws, and horns).

#### Sorcerous Thirst
Starting at 13th level, whenever you perform mana siphon versus demons to
drain their mana, you gain double the normal mana, and they suffer disadvantage to saving throws
against the effect.

You also gain the Essence Touch talent, but can only affect demons with it. For instance, if you
siphon a Felhound‘s mana, you can utilize their mana burn innate ability, or a succubus‘s sleep or
modify memory spell if you siphon it instead.

If you kill a target or reduce it to 0 hit points while it is affected by a warlock‘s mark ability (see
Soul Shards under the Warlock class), you also regain 1d6 hit points. You cannot gain this more
than 1/round. The warlock does not gain the soul shard in this case.

#### Dark Mastery
Starting at 17th level, you can access the demonic doom, gate, and foresight warlock
spells as if 6th level spells, and can cast them normally. If you can access higher-level spells, you can
cast one of the aforementioned spells once every long rest for no cost instead.
Also, you gain another Mystic Blast enhancement when in your avatar form.

### Mountain King (Warrior)
The mountain kings, or thanes as they are known in Khaz Modan, are the mightiest dwarven
warriors under the mountain. Wielding both enchanted warhammers and hand axes, these fierce
fighters live to test themselves against worthy opponents. Unconcerned with their race's
preoccupation with mechanical devices and mining precious minerals, Mountain Kings live only
for battle. Dedicated to safeguarding the Alliance which saved their kingdom during the Second
War, the mountain Kings can be counted upon to rally behind any banner that stands between
freedom and the ever looming shadow of evil.

Mountain kings boast prodigious combat abilities. They are ferocious in melee combat, wielding
the traditional weapons of their race to decimate their foes. Their attacks leave opponents stunned
and reeling.

While they do not focus their efforts on discovering the secrets of the titans, they have long known
of a powerful spark within every Ironforge dwarf - and mountain kings draw upon this spark and
fan it into a raging flame. They conjure magic hammers and axes to hurl at their targets, stunning
and slowing them so they can get close enough to use their real weapons. They transform
themselves into silver-sheened creatures of living stone, shrugging off all attacks and hacking
through flesh and bone with frightening ease.

This archetype is restricted to dwarves and creatures who are of titanic descent.

#### Titanic Spark
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells as a mage of
an effective caster level equal to 0.5 your Mountain King level (minimum 0). You do require
spellbooks, however, as the spells manifest in the form of inscriptions and engravings on your
armor, weapons, or runes that you draw at the spell‘s range
(treat as tattoos), but otherwise use the

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

same rules as the mage (effectively treating runes as mage tattoos). You also do not need to
concentrate on the stoneskin spell.

You may cast spells from the abjuration, evocation, and transmutation schools, although you may
only choose lightning or thunder-based spells when preparing evocation spells. Your spellcasting
ability is Intelligence.

You may treat the investiture of stone spell as a 5th level spell instead of a 6th level spell, and stoneskin
as a 3rd level spell instead of a 4th level spell. You also add the hammer of wrath paladin spell to
your spell list.

#### Thunderlord
Also starting at 3rd level, you gain the Thunder Clap talent (if you didn‘t already
have it), and can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a rest,
not once per rest, and exclude a number of targets from the spell‘s area of effect equal to your
Strength modifier.

Also, you gain the Dual Wielder feat if you didn‘t already have it. If you already have it, you add +1
to your weapon damage rolls with either weapon.

Stance of the Mountain. Starting at 7th level, you may enter a stance with a bonus action. So long
as you are in this stance, you reduce the physical damage you take by 3 points, and gain 2 extra
reactions. The stance ends if you choose to end it or if you move more than half your normal
speed.

When executing a melee attack of opportunity while under the effects of this stance, you push the
target a number feet equal to your Strength score on a successful damage roll.

#### Bleed and Bash
Starting at 10th level, you gain the Mutilate Strike and Stunning Slam talents, and
can use either strike abilities when making an off-hand attack as part of the same action. You can
also apply other strike effects as part of an off-hand attack, but you suffer a -2 penalty to your
damage rolls.

\pagebreakNum

Lastly, you can make an attack of opportunity against any creature that critically hits you or
successfully strikes an ally within 5 feet.

#### Titanic Avatar
Starting at 15th level, whenever you cast the spell stoneskin through your Titanic
Spark spellcasting feature, the cost of the material component (regardless of the target) is 25 gp
instead of 100. You also gain the benefits of the enlarge spell without requiring concentration, and
so long as you are wielding a weapon in both hands, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.

Furthermore, you may spend three days studying the defenses of a fortification, castle, or any type
of defensive structure. At the end of the three days, you may use your Stance of the Mountain
without spending a bonus action, and you may move your full speed without disrupting the stance,
and ignore natural difficult terrain in the area with your movement, so long as it is part of the
fortification (such as ignoring a natural barricade or debris).

#### Lord of the Mountain
Starting at 18th level, you can manifest your titanic heritage as a true
avatar.

You can use an action to cast the stoneskin spell (also benefitting from the enlarge spell as via Titanic
Avatar) for no material cost. Also, your skin gains a silvery sheen, and you gain the following
benefits while benefitting from the spell:
* At the start of each of your turns, you regain 5 hit points (up until your Bloodied value).
* You increase your weapons‘ reach by 5 feet.
* You can make an attack of opportunity against any creature that successfully attacks an ally
  within 10 feet.

### Runeweaver (Monk)
Most monks are Pandaren, but others still have less structured beliefs, and channel runic power
through tattoos or runes drawn upon their flesh. These runeweavers are rarely found, but have
dwarven and tauren practitioners.

The runeweaver is a mystic who sees the power and importance of ley lines. Moreover, those who
study runes understand that these are not simply symbols of power — they are power. The
runeweaver seeks to become one with the land, but not in the fashion of druids or shamans.

Rather, the runeweaver desires to become a microcosm of the land, seeking to overlay his body with
runes in the same fashion that the land itself is overlaid with patterns of ley lines and the echoes of
the might of the great Titans.

The tradition itself dates back to the times of the ancient titans, mastered by the dwarves who
learned such arts from their creators. As the centuries rolled past, most dwarves lost their heritage
and their knowledge of this art. Tauren claim ancient traditions when passing down runic
attunements, bringing closer dwarf, tauren, and pandaren by sheer curiosity to learn the truth.

Most runeweavers are heavily tattooed with runic patterns — not simply the unique ones that form
the basis for rune families, but the so-called ―simple runes‖ as well. Simple runes mimic patterns of
ley energy that appear, again and again, in the environment. These patterns occur in nature and are
responsible for things such as the strength of a given type of stone, the ferocity of a given
windstorm and the coolness of a given stream; when a runeweaver uses these patterns, he learns to
channel his natural power into them at all times, attaining similar traits.

Ki is commonly known as Runic Pulse with runeweavers, but functions the same way.


#### Runic Attunement
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that
harness the power of the runic ley lines. An attunement requires you to spend ki points each

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

time you use it. You know the Simple Runes discipline and one other runic attunement of your choice,
which are detailed in the "Runic Attunements‖ section below.

You learn one additional runic attunement of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new runic attunement, you can also replace one runic attunement that you
already know with a different attunement. Some effects are strike effects, in which case they require
a bonus action to manifest as well, and affect a target struck by you.

##### Ley Attunement
You may also replace an existing runic attunement by meditating near a center of
ley power, such as a mana fountain, place of elemental strength (a great volcano, on a mountain, or
near the Maelstrom), or similar effect the DM specifies (such as where ancient Elven Runestones
stand, or near the mechanisms of the Titans). In all cases, this can be changed at the end of a long
rest. Each area of ley attunement grants its own Runic Attunement.

You can also burn some of your life force to manifest a runic attunement instead of spending Ki.

You can spend hit dice (as if healing), but you do not gain hit points. Instead, each hit dice of
healing you expend acts as if you spend 1 Ki point for a runic attunement effect. This usually

expending the cost the rune, but the
inscribed rune doesn't come into effect.

Instead, it takes effect when a certain
circumstance occurs. You describe that
circumstance.

For example, a contingency cast with the
Mangroves Rune might stipulate that it
comes into effect when you are subject to the
paralyzed condition (or any or all of the
conditions). You can have only one inscribed

### Shadow Hunter (Hunter)
Troll shadow hunters are the highest authority of the jungle trolls. Their spirit powers both bless and curse, and they walk the line of dark and light in hope of saving the future of their people. Their dark gods, the Loa, channel themselves through the shadow hunters when they use their ceremonial Rush'kah masks. In some circles, Shadow Hunter is a title bestowed equally among hunters of this specialization and witch doctors.

Like other practitioners of voodoo, shadow hunters deal with the darker aspects of the spirit world. Unlike witch doctors (who excel in channeling voodoo magic and alchemy), Shadow Hunters claim a strong bond with the Loa, animal spirits thought to be divine in nature.

Able to channel the essence of some of these extremely potent beings - and often acting with their blessing, conduit, and mortal champions - shadow hunters gain special abilities only the Loa can grant. As they grow in experience, the shadow hunters' bond with the Loa strengthens and their connection to these powerful voodoo spirits eventually gives them the ability to curse and heal at a whim. The strongest shadow hunters can create a pit of shadow filled with terrible beings that can tear their enemies apart.
This archetype is restricted to worshipers of the Loa, which are overwhelmingly trolls. Shadow hunters typically utilize Warglaives for combat (see equipment).

#### Loa Spellcasting
Starting upon gaining this archetype, you access the shaman’s spell list. You do not gain the increased spellcasting capabilities or access to higher spell levels, but you add all shaman spells of spell levels you can access to your hunter spell list (including totems, healing spells, and elemental spells). You may also add the darkness spell to your shared spell list. Your own sight is unaffected by your darkness spell.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

Your spellcasting otherwise follows the same rules as the shaman class, although your totems (or spellbooks) are your masks.

#### Mask Magic
Starting from 3rd level, you can wear various Rush'kah masks can provide blessings, channeling the power of chosen Loa. You can spend 6 hours creating a suite of these magic masks (up to all the ones you know), and they have nearly negligible weight. So long as you have such masks, you can wear them with a bonus action, applying a special benefit as described below. Once a mask is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest.

* *Legba Mask.* You cast the haste spell.
* *Lukou Mask.* You add your Spirit modifier to the final number of hit points healed by your hunter or shaman spells. This can be added to the final damage to undead cured by said spells. This mask grants the benefit for one hour.
* *Shango Mask.* You add your Spirit modifier to the final number of damage points dealt by your hunter or shaman lightning spells. This mask grants the benefit for one hour.
___
If a mask is destroyed, it takes 1 hour per mask to create a new one from simple materials.

#### Voodoo Ritualist
Starting from 7th level, you may triple the casting time of your hunter spells via a magical (and often noisy) mask-dance to heighten it by one spell level. This increase does not stack with itself, but can increase the spell level beyond your normal maximum (cannot exceed 9th level). You can use this ability to heighten the spell level of a spell cast through a mask (such as the Legba or Bwonsamdi masks). For instance, if the spell’s casting time is 1
action, it costs 3

\pagebreakNum

actions instead. If its casting time is 1 hour, it costs 3 hours, etc. This is applied to ritual spells normally.

#### Advanced Mask Magic
Starting at 11th level, you can add new masks to your repertoire.

* *Bwonsamdi Mask.* You treat the exorcism spell as a bonus spell that you prepared (hunter spell list). You may cast the spell normally or apply it as a strike effect. This benefit remains for one hour. This affects all undead except undead shadows.
* *Ogoun and Dambala Masks.* You can cast the polymorph spell. If you are later able to prepare the spell, it instead costs 2 less mana points (minimum 1) while the mask is active (this cancels out the penalty from the Loa spellcasting feature above). This is usually used to turn yourself into a snake, or turn your enemy into a frog or likewise helpless critter.
* *The Dark Mask.* You cast the big bad voodoo spell. This costs 16 mana.

#### Pit of Shadows
Starting on 15th level, whenever you cast the darkness spell, you can reduce its duration to Concentration (Partial), up to 1 minute. While enhanced this way, however, all spells you cast that deal shadow damage or that conjure shadows cost 2 less mana points (minimum 0), so long the spell does not target an area or a creature outside the darkness. If the darkness spell was heightened by your Voodoo Ritualist ability (making it more resilient against being defeated by light spells), then spells that deal shadow damage or conjure shadows are similarly heightened (as described under the spells’ descriptions).

Once this feature is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Alternatively, this ability can consume one of the uses of a mask you didn’t use yet.

### Spell Breaker (Warrior)
Elven warriors trained to disrupt and contort magical energies, the Spell Breakers are a valuable
addition to the Alliance, and work well in concert with the High Elven magically-focused military.

Spell Breakers can cast a small amount of spells, and mostly prefer abjurations such as shield and
dispel magic, and evocations such as arcane missile, and mana burn.

This warrior martial archetype is restricted to elves, commonly High Elves and Blood Elves.

#### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast
spells.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each spell breaker level provides you with 0.5 levels in the mage class (or level 1 at 3rd level). You
follow the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section). You
prepare spells from the mage spell list, but only spells from the Abjuration, Divination, Evocation,
or Transmutation schools.

When you reach 7th, 8th, 14, and 20 level in this class, you can alter one existing spell to be a spell
from any other magic school.

Your spellcasting otherwise follows the same rules as the mage class with regards to spellbooks,
conjuring and binding, and other concerns. Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

#### Spell Resistance
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can spend an action and 3
mana points to become exceptionally resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, gaining advantage
versus all spells that allow for spell resistance. This lasts for 1 hour.

If you succeed in saving against a spell with both saving throws (the one granted by advantage as
well as your normal one, even without using the spell resistance feature), you may use a reaction to
absorb residual mana, gaining mana points equal to the spell‘s level. This is a normal manarestorative effect.

#### Abjuring Knight
Starting at 7th level, you may cast the dispel magic and counterspell spells with one less mana point, and always have them prepared.

You may also throw a two-bladed sword, treating it as a thrown weapon with a range of 10/30 feet. This may deliver melee strikes at range, and the two-bladed sword returns after the attack roll is resolved, but allowing for only one melee strike every round.

#### Feedback
At 10th level, whenever you dispel or counterspell a magical effect from a creature, you destroy 2 mana points per spell level you used. Each mana point burned deals 1d4 arcane damage to the target.

If you dispel an effect from an ally, you may manifest one of the following effects:
* You can direct the mana-burning effect to any hostile creature within 30 feet of you. This is negated on a successful a Spirit saving throw against your Spell save DC.

\pagebreakNum

* You can gain a bonus to melee and thrown weapon damage rolls equal to the highest-spell level you dispelled or counterspelled. The bonus decreases by 1 point at the end of your turn every round until it reaches 0.

#### Steal Magic
At 15th level, you may transfer a dispelled or counterspelled magical effect to another
eligible creature within 30 ft. This does not require an action. The new target is entitled a saving
throw, or you must succeed on an attack roll to affect them (as if you cast the initial spell).

Also, you can target spells cast by your allies with the dispel magic spell. If you would have
successfully dispelled the spell, you can instead change its target or extend its duration.

#### Greater Spell Steal
Starting at 18th level, you always have the spell steal spell prepared, and does
not count against the number of spells prepared. The spell also costs 1 less mana point for you.

Furthermore, your spell resistance ability is permanent.

### Witch Doctor (Shaman)
A curious blend of alchemy and shamanistic spirit magic, witch doctors are most common among
trolls, though few orcs take up the art, especially those who wish to broaden their skill set with the
power of alchemy. Skilled at not only simply brewing potions and alchemical goods, but also at
awakening the spirits of the ingredients that go into his goods, a witch doctor at work can be
unsettling. Between crooning and chanting to the herbs and animal parts that go into their brew,
shaking rattles to supposedly ‗wake up the spirits‘, to bursting into dance to appease them and
make them favor him, a witch doctor inspires fear, respect, and confusion.

The witch doctor's arcane magical art is formed from the ability to twist and turn nature through a
crude yet effective science called juju.

Witch doctors teach that worthy trolls receive dominion over various aspects of nature upon their
death - whether plants, weather, beasts, or even disease. When witch doctors exhibit their
supernatural powers to cure the sick, control nature, or assist in battle, it is said that ancestral
spirits are riding them.

Witch doctors usually name their totems ‗Wards‘, and use masks as their spellbooks, although their
mask mojo is not as strong as shadow hunters, who are more martial in nature.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Witch Doctor Art

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Death pact, dissonant whispers |
| 3rd | Berserker frenzy, divine shield (or bad voodoo) |
| 5th | Banshee‘s curse, fear |
| 7th | Drain life, polymorph (or ghost wolf) |
| 9th | Big bad voodoo, eyebite |

</div>

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:400px;"></div>

#### Weird Juju
Starting at 1st level, you gain the Alchemy ability, and proficiency in both Alchemist‘s
Supplies and the Poisoner‘s Kit. You can choose up to one alchemist spells to cast as a potion, and
gain access to another alchemist spell whenever you level up. These spells can only be made into
potions (as if you were an alchemist). You can scribe potion formulae into your totem, and do not
require a formula book.

#### Channel Elements: Voodoo Witchery
At 2nd level, you can spend a Channel Elements use to reawaken fading magics. This can extend concentration spells for one more round, and reset the
durations of a spell or potion whose duration ended or was dispelled, including sigils or totems, but
not strikes or shots. If the duration ended normally, it regains half the duration it once had. This
cannot affect instantaneous spells or spells with a duration more than 24 hours.

This usually involves dancing and waving fetishes at the target.

#### Dark Sacrifice
At 6th level, you may end any conjure spell you have active with a bonus action, and
ignite the residual magic. You may center an explosion with a radius of 10 feet at the point where
your conjured creature was last present that deals 1d8 damage per spell level, halved on a successful
Stamina saving throw. Half the damage is acid, and the other half is poison. You may use this
ability on a target of a successful death pact spell.

If you conjured multiple creatures, the explosion takes place at each of the spaces. The damage does
not stack. If you used Voodoo Witchery on the same concentration spell, the saving throw is done
with disadvantage.

#### Personal Mojo
Starting at 8th level, you gain proficiency in magically-infused potions beyond
regular science. You gain the following abilities, which you can bestow upon any potion you make
or handle for at least 1 minute.

\pagebreakNum

* *Personalized Mojo.* You can personalize a potion for a specific creature by mixing a part of them
  (hair, nail clippings, a tear, etc.) into it. This potion functions only for the target, and is treated
  as if heightened one spell level (this can exceed your normal maximum spell level). If the
  potion has no benefit when targeting a creature (such as an area of effect spell or a potion that
  conjures a creature), or when heightened, the potion can instead be reused with a successful
  DC 15 Intelligence check with Alchemist‘s Supplies, so far as you use an action when adjacent
  to the potion (or target) within 1 minute of it being used. This can be attempted once.
* *Rage Mojo.* You imbue your potion a spirit of rage and battle. When the potion is consumed,
  the target is also enraged, as the berserker rage spell, for the full duration (or until you command
  it to end as a bonus action or reaction). The target does not suffer a level of exhaustion if it
  succeeds on a Stamina saving throw against your Spell DC at the end of the rage.
* *Spirit Mojo.* You augment the potion with a spirit of balance, allowing you to mix two potions
  to retain the benefits of both (as the Proper Sync miscibility result), so long as both potions
  have the same quality. This can be done once per short rest.
* *Shaka Mojo.* You augment the potion with a spirit of might. When you roll for damage or
  healing with the potion, it deals the maximum effect instead, so long as you use it. You may
  have only one shaka mojo potion active at any given time.
* *Strange Mojo.* This potion houses a tiny, wild spirit. When this potion is consumed with other
  ones, roll twice for miscibility and choose your favored result. This stacks with other re-rolls of
  miscibility. You can only have one strange mojo potion active at any given time.

#### Spiritual Intervention
When you reach level 17, you can invoke the spirits of Loa to aid you. You
may spend your action and bonus action in a ritualistic dance. At the start of your turn in the next
round, you can change a prepared spell you have to any other spell on the shaman spell list of a
level you can cast. Once this feature is used a number of times equal to your Spirit bonus, it cannot
be used again until you complete a long rest.

If you use of your elemental intervention ability, you can choose any other spell list instead of only
the shaman spell list, but the spell you choose must be one spell level lower than the spell you
altered. This costs the same mana cost as the original spell. This spell remains prepared for 8 hours
or until cast, after which it fades and your original altered spell returns. This counts as a successful
use of the elemental intervention ability, and does not require a roll to succeed.

\pagebreakNum

<a id="companions"></a>

### Bound Companions
Characters‘ class abilities sometimes provide companions. Companions are creatures that have
lower challenge rating than the character, and join the character in their adventures free of charge.

These creatures do not grant XP when killed, and do not consume XP when fighting, but are
effectively bound to the character who has the ability, leveling up with them in some capacity
(gaining hit dice, ability score increases, etc., as detailed in the class entry).

The ability that provides the bound companion determines the creature type (usually beast), the
CR, and whether the companion gains special abilities.

Some abilities allow you to increase the strength of your bond with your companion. In this case,
you may be allowed to add your Proficiency bonus to the companion‘s attack rolls or saving throws
(or other rolls). This does not stack with the creature‘s own Proficiency Bonus.

#### Controlling the Companion
The companion obeys its master‘s commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on its master‘s
initiative.

On the master‘s turn, the companion can be verbally commanded where to move (no action
required by you) or what to do. If the creature has a special bond, the master may or may not be
able to command it telepathically, depending on the bond‘s description.

Bound companions otherwise act on their own, unless given a clear command from their master, in
which case they fulfill the command as best as they can. Giving a bound companion a direct order
(so long as they are not telepathically connected) costs an attack action.

The master is always aware of the bound companion‘s normal course of action. If the master is
incapacitated or absent, the companion acts as it normally would, but also protects its master and
itself.

For example, a hunter with a panther companion is attacked in an ambush. The panther, if
commanded to fight, would normally attack the weakest enemy from behind. If the hunter uses an
attack to command the panther to fight in sync with him, the panther obeys and fights as its master
wishes.

### Class Talents

Some classes allow you to take talents, which are customizable class features that can enrich and
reinforce a certain character concept.

All talent abilities have DCs of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Agility modifier (your
choice) if they allow a saving throw.

#### Action Surge
**Prerequisite.** 1 level in Warrior
<br>
You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. This talent can be taken again at level 17 for another use.

#### Aggressive
You may use your bonus action to take the Dash action, but only to approach a hostile creature that you can see.

#### Agile Leap
**Prerequisite.** 5th level
<br>
You may use a bonus action to leap, moving at half your total speed. This movement does not provoke reactions. If you have the ability to glide, hover, or fly (via spell, gadget, or ability), you may choose to use this ability in mid-air (effectively changing your trajectory as a double-jump). This jump also counts as a Dash action for the purposes of other abilities.

You are treated as if you always benefit from the jump spell.

If you also have the Heroic Leap talent, a use of the ability increases your jump distance to your full speed for that use.

#### Berserker Rage
**Prerequisite.** Must be taken at 1st level of Warrior.
<br>
You may cast the berserker frenzy spell on yourself as a bonus action. This rage continues until you end it with a bonus action, or until the rage ends early (as per the spell’s description), and you can use it as limited by the spell’s description.

This spell cannot be dispelled, but can be overwhelmed by a calm emotions spell or similar effect that would suppress this ability, and does not prevent use of spell-like abilities derived from talents.

You can take this talent again. If you do so, you do not gain a level of exhaustion at the end (regardless of how long you rage).

If you reach 9th level of Warrior, your rage only ends if you are knocked unconscious or if you end it willingly.

#### Bladestorm
**Prerequisite.** 1 level in Warrior
<br>
You may enter this stance with an action. While in this stance, you whirl with your weapon outstretched, automatically dealing your melee weapon damage to all creatures within the weapon’s reach of you. This damage is treated as an area effect. Affected targets are entitled an Agility saving throw to halve the damage. You can apply strike effects, but they affect only targets who failed their saving throw, and one strike affects one target.

You cannot take any other actions in this stance other than maintaining it. You can enter this stance a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before replenishing on a

\columnbreak

short rest, and the effects of it remaining until the beginning of your turn in the next round unless you extend it using the same actions.

While in this stance, you have advantage against all movement-impairing effects or effects that result in loss of control for your character, and you do not provoke reactions from movement from a creature who has failed their saving throw to half damage. Your speed, however, is halved in this stance. If you are unable to use your action, or if you cannot move at least 5 feet every round, this stance ends. If you are in this stance more than 3 rounds, you gain the incapacitated condition for after you are finished. The condition remains for 1 round per round you were in the stance beyond the first three.

#### Brutal Critical
You can roll one additional weapon damage
die when determining the extra damage for a
critical hit with a melee weapon attack. This
talent can be taken again up to two times
(resulting in three additional dice).

#### Burning Blades
**Prerequisite.** 1 level in Hunter or Warrior
<br>
As a bonus action, you can ignite any
number of weapons you are wielding with
magical energies. The weapon acts as if it
gained the Elemental Damage Infusion (deals
1d6 extra elemental damage) for 1 minute
and becomes magical. If you end your turn
without attacking a target (without necessarily
hitting them), the weapon loses the infusion
and is extinguished. You have a number of
uses of this ability (and can ignite a total
number of weapons) equal to your Strength
or Stamina modifier (minimum 1).

Despite the talent‘s name, you can choose
which damage type the weapon deals (not
necessarily fire) upon gaining this talent. You
regain all the uses of this ability at the end of
a long rest. You can regain a single use if you
kill or reduce a creature to 0 hit points, so
long as that creature can deal the same type
of elemental damage (such as by spell, attack,
or aura).

#### Camouflage
**Prerequisite.** 9th level<br>
You can use the Hide action as a bonus
action on your turn. If you are also proficient
with the Agility (Stealth) skill, you may cast
the invisibility spell by spending an action and
a bonus action. After being used, the spell
cannot be used again until after a short rest.

Also, you can‘t be tracked by nonmagical
means, unless you choose to leave a trail,
even outside your favored terrain (if you have
one).

#### Cloak of Shadows
**Prerequisite.** The ability to cast spells or proficiency in Stealth
<br>
You cloak yourself with bits of the fading
shadows of mana, hiding even from the
effects of spells that affect you.

As a Bonus Action, you can cloak yourself with
magical shadows for until the end of your
turn in the next round. Any spell of a spell
level less than one-half your level (round
down) cast upon you can't affect you or
anything you hold. Such a spell can target you or something you hold, but the spell has
no effect. Similarly, your area is excluded
from the areas affected by such spells. You
can activate your Cloak of Shadows ability for
a total number of rounds equal to one-half
your level, replenishing on a long rest, and
can extend an active cloak of shadows with
no action so long as you have remaining
rounds.

\pagebreakNum

You may cloak yourself as a reaction instead,
but each round consumed this way costs
double the normal number of rounds of this
ability. This effect otherwise acts as a globe of
invulnerability spell of a spell level equal to
one-half your level (round down).

#### Cunning Action
**Prerequisite.** 1 level in Rogue
<br>
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to
move and act quickly. You can take a bonus
action on each of your turns in combat to use
the following action: Dash, Disengage, or
Hide.

#### Danger Sense
You gain an uncanny sense of when things
nearby aren‘t as they should be, giving you an
edge when you dodge away from danger. You
have advantage on Agility saving throws
against effects that you can see, such as traps
and spells. To gain this benefit, you can‘t be
blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. You
must be able to see the effect before it takes
place (such as seeing a character cast a spell
or the outer mechanism of the trap).

#### Defensive Stance [Stance]
**Prerequisite.** Proficiency and use of a shield
<br>
You may enter this stance with a bonus
action. While in this stance, you have
resistance against piercing damage.

This stance is broken if you move more than
half your full movement in a single round, or
if you are no longer using a shield.

#### Deflect Missiles
**Prerequisite.** 1 level of Monk
<br>
You can use your reaction to deflect or catch
a ranged weapon attack you are hit by. When
you do so, the damage you take from the
attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Strength or
Agility modifier (your choice) + your level.

If you reduce the damage to 0 and you have
at least 2 Monk levels, you can catch the
missile if it is small enough for you to hold in
one hand and you have at least one hand
free. If you catch a missile in this way, you
can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack
with the weapon or piece of ammunition you
just caught, as part of the same reaction. You
make this attack with proficiency, regardless
of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile
counts as a monk weapon for the attack. The
range of this ability is 20/60 feet.

#### Dark Ranger
**Prerequisite.** 1 level in Hunter
<br>
You add the following spells to your hunter
spell list: banshee‟s curse, death coil, death pact,
drain life, death ward, and silence. You may also
add undead to the list of creatures you can
bind and conjure (allowing you to also charm
and dominate undead).

#### Dire Strike
**Prerequisite.** 1 level in Rogue
<br>
You strike at a vulnerable place in the target's
body when you may deal your sneak attack
damage. Instead of dealing extra sneak attack
damage, you may impose a condition on the
target on a failed Stamina saving throw. The
weapon damage type determines the
condition, chosen from the below.
* *Blinded (any).* The target is blinded
  for until the end of their turn in the
  next round.
* *Kidney Shot (piercing or bludgeoning,
  requires level 5).* The target is stunned
  until the end of their turn in the
  next round.
* *Rupture (slashing or piercing).* The
  target gains the bleeding condition
  for 1 minute, with the value of blood
  loss equal to your Agility modifier.
  Furthermore, unless they take
  precautions, they leave a trail of
  blood behind them.
  The creature can attempt another
  Stamina saving throw at the
  beginning of every round to end this
  effect. Creatures that do have blood
  (or do not require it to survive)
  cannot be harmed by bleeding.
* *Sap (bludgeoning).* The creature is
  charmed for one minute and looks
  visibly dazed and flat-footed. While
  charmed by this effect, the creature is
  incapacitated and has a speed of 0.
  The effect ends for an affected
  creature if it takes any damage or if
  someone else uses an action to shake
  the creature out of its stupor. The
  creature can attempt another
  Stamina saving throw once every
  round to end this effect. Once a
  creature is affected by this ability, it
  is immune to it until it performs a
  short rest.
___
For each saving throw attempt the target
makes against a dire strike ability, they gain a
cumulative +1 to their saving throws against
this ability. This applies to saving throws
rolled every round as well as new applications
of effects that were already chosen. The
bonus to saving throws remains for up to 24
hours. If the rupture strike, for example, has
a DC of 14 the first round, the DC decreases
to 13 the second round, and 12 the third
round. If choosing kidney shot, the DC
decreases the more the ability is applied.

#### Dread Ambusher
You master the art of the ambush. You gain a
bonus your initiative rolls equal to your Spirit
modifier. Also, the start of your first turn of
each combat encounter, your speed increases
by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that
turn. When you retreat from combat, you
have advantage to any Agility (Stealth) check
to escape being pursued.

#### Elusive
**Prerequisite.** 17th level and 1 level in Rogue
<br>
You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain
the upper hand against you. No attack roll
has advantage against you while you aren‘t
incapacitated.

#### Essence Touch
**Prerequisite.** 1 level in Hunter or Monk of 5th
level
<br>
Whenever you touch a creature with innate
special abilities (such as innate spellcasting),
you can gain one use of their innate special
abilities, usable only once before the essence
fades away. This costs no mana, but you
cannot steal an ability that is also a spell
unless you had the level to cast it normally.

Monks referring to their ki spell ability for
the purposes of this talent.

#### Evasion
**Prerequisite.** 5th level and 1 level in Hunter,
Monk, or Rogue
<br>
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of
certain area effects, such as a dragon‘s fiery
breath or an ice storm spell. When you are
subjected to an effect that allows you to make
an Agility saving throw to take half damage,
you instead take no damage if you succeed on
the saving throw, and only half damage if you
fail.

\pagebreakNum

Execute
Prerequisite. 1 level in Warrior
Your attack carries with it the weight of
doom. If you successfully deal damage with
this strike effect against a bloodied target, the
attack deals 50% extra damage.
After being used, this cannot be used again
until after a short rest. If the target is killed
or reduced to 0 hit points by this strike, you
regain the use of it. If the target has any
ability that would prevent it from being
reduced to 0 hit points when it otherwise
should have (such as the Relentless talent,
the Undead Fortitude trait, or similar ability
that would allow an escape) it must make a
Stamina saving throw against your DC or else
it fails and it is reduced to 0 hit points.
This talent can be taken multiple times, each
time adding another use before requiring a
short rest. This is a strike effect.
Fading Shadow
Prerequisite. Subtlety specialization or the
Cloak of Shadows talent
You may cast the blink step spell. After being
used, this cannot be used again until after a
short rest. This talent can be taken multiple
times, each time adding another two uses of
this ability before a short rest. If your level is
9, each use acts as the dimension door spell
instead.
Fan of Knives
Whenever you use an action to attack with a
light throwing weapon (such as daggers,
darts, light hammers, handaxes, or javelins),
you may throw another of the same type as
part of the same attack action. You may still
use two-weapon fighting to throw a third
weapon as a bonus action. This stacks with
the Extra Attack feature, if you possess it
(adding one thrown attack with the first
action for each extra attack).
You may instead spend your action and
bonus action to release the same number of
weapons as a 20-foot sphere (all around you),
a 15-foot cone (in a quarter-circle), or a line
30 feet long, 5 feet wide in any direction you
choose. This requires throwing up to three
weapons, and deals damage as if they all hit,
with an Agility saving throw to half damage.
Special. If you have the Sneak Attack feature,
you may add one additional point of damage
per sneak attack dice to the total damage, but
only if the target qualifies for a sneak attack.
This is an area effect.
Favored Enemy
You may the Favored Enemy ability as a 1st
level Hunter, or choose another favored
enemy if you normally have it (such as by
being a hunter). You cannot take this talent
more than 3 times.
Favored by Elune
Prerequisite. At least 1 level in Hunter and the
ability to cast spells
You may add the find familiar spell to your
spell list, but may only choose an owl as a
familiar. Furthermore, your link to your owl
familiar is 250 feet, instead of the normal
100 feet. If you are standing in moonlight,
the link becomes 500 feet instead. If you later
choose the Beastmaster Hunter archetype,
you may make your familiar your bonded
creature, in which case the creature is treated
as both a familiar and hunter‘s companion.
Farsight
You increase the range of all ranged weapons
of one type (crossbows, bows, firearms, axes,
etc.) by half.
Feral Senses
Prerequisite. 17th level and proficiency in
Perception
You gain preternatural senses that help you
fight creatures you can‘t see. When you
attack a creature you can‘t see, your inability
to see it doesn‘t impose disadvantage on your
attack rolls against it. You also permanently
benefit from the see invisibility spell as if you
cast it, but only so long as the enemy is
within 60 feet.
Flash Bomber
Prerequisite. 5th level
You may use a bonus action or reaction to
activate or make use of the Use Object action
for alchemical items or explosives. This may
be used at a number of times equal to your
Intelligence modifier before a short rest.
Focused Attack
Prerequisite. Requires the ability to attack
multiple times in one round
You may choose to deal focused attacks
instead of risking missed attacks. Whenever
you score a successful ranged attack and have
any remaining attacks (such as from the Extra
Attack feature or the haste spell), you may
spend the extra attacks to add the minimum
possible damage the weapon attack to your
damage result. The damage is resolved as
made by one weapon attack (and uses one
point of ammunition as normal, or one
malfunction check). For instance, if you
successfully deal a longbow ranged attack for
1d8 + 4, and have an additional attack from
the haste spell, you may expend the attack to
add 5 points of damage to the initial attack
(for a total of 1d8 + 9) damage.
Hamstring
As a strike, you may cut a target‘s hamstring.
The target‘s movement speed is reduced by
10 feet for one minute. Also, whenever they
move more than half their speed or whenever
they use the Dash action, they fall prone. The
target (or an ally) may use an action to roll a
Stamina saving throw against this ability,
which ends the condition. It ends
automatically at the end of a short rest.
This speed reduction can be applied multiple
times, to a minimum speed of 0 (in which
case the target is treated as if restrained). This
is a strike effect. This strike can be used a
number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, with the uses replenishing at the end
of a short rest.
Heroic Leap
Prerequisite. 1 level in Monk or Warrior
You may make a heroic leap, jumping up to
twice your normal distance, and can spend
an action at the end. If the action is a melee
attack roll, it deals damage equal to your
normal weapon damage in a 10-foot sphere,
centered on the area you landed on, with an
Agility saving throw to half damage. The
ground is also turned into difficult terrain
(such as rubble) if applicable. Once used, this
talent cannot be used again until after a short
rest. Only warriors and monks may take this
talent.
Heroic Throw
You may throw a weapon further than it can
normally go, or throw a melee weapon that
does not have that property. You may
increase the range of an existing thrown
weapon by 60 feet, or give a melee weapon
the thrown property (20/60 feet) for one
round.
On a hit, the weapon can either return to
you after being thrown at a target, or knock
the target prone (Agility save negates),
dropping 5 feet from the target. This is a
strike effect.
Hunter's Sense
Prerequisite. 9th level and Primeval Alertness
or Favored Enemy
You can cast the scrying spell, but can only
affect a creature detected by primeval
alertness or a favored enemy. The creature
must be within 10 miles of you to be affected
by this ability. You may use this ability once
per long rest. This talent can be taken
multiple times, each time increasing the
times this ability can be used per long rest by
two.
Indomitable
Prerequisite. 9th level
You can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If
you do so, you must use the new roll, even if
it is lower than the initial roll. You may use
this talent a number of times equal to onehalf your proficiency bonus.
Indomitable Might
Prerequisite. 5th level
If you roll a Strength check and the results
are less than your Strength score, treat the
result as your Strength score instead.
Iron Willed Hunter
Prerequisite. 5th level and at least 1 level in
Hunter
You have honed your ability to resist mindaltering powers. You gain proficiency in
Spirit saving throws. If you already have this
proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in
Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your
choice).
Insightful Fighting
Prerequisite. 1 level in Rogue
You gain the ability to decipher an
opponent's tactics and develop a counter to
them. As a bonus action, you can make a
Spirit (Insight) check against a creature you
can see that isn‘t incapacitated, contested by
the target‘s Charisma (Deception) check. If
you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack
against that target even if you don‘t have
advantage on the attack roll, but not if you
have disadvantage, so long as you spend your
bonus action to maintain this effect. This
benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you
successfully use this feature against a different
target.
Insightful Manipulator
Prerequisite. 9th level
If you spend at least 1 minute observing or
interacting with another creature outside
combat, you can learn certain information
about its capabilities compared to your own.
The DM tells you if the creature is your
equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two
of the following characteristics of your
choice:
 Intelligence, Spirit, or Charisma
scores
 Class levels (if any)
At the DM‘s option, you might also realize
you know a piece of the creature‘s history or
one of its personality traits, if it has any.
Land’s Stride
Prerequisite. 5th level and at least 1 level in
Hunter or Monk
You may move through nonmagical difficult
terrain without spending extra movement,
and gain a +10 bonus to your speed. You can
also pass through nonmagical plants without
being slowed by them and without taking
damage from them if they have thorns,
spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you
have advantage on saving throws against
plants that are magically created or
manipulated to impede movement, such
those created by the entangling roots spell.
Magic-User’s Nemesis
Prerequisite. 5th level
You can thwart someone else‘s magic. When
you see a creature casting a spell or
teleporting within 30 feet of you, you can use
your reaction to try to foil it, either by using
your own magic (if you can access spells), or
an attack roll (by using a ranged or thrown
weapon). The creature must succeed on a
Spirit saving throw against your spell save DC
or you must succeed on an attack roll,
otherwise its spell or teleport fails and is
wasted.
Master Manipulator
You can use the Help action as a bonus
action. Additionally, when you use the Help
action to aid an ally in attacking a creature,
the target of that attack can be within 30 feet
of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the
target can see or hear you. You also gain
proficiency with the disguise and forgery kits,
and one gaming set of your choice. You also
learn two languages of your choice. Lastly,
you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns
and accent of a creature that you hear speak
for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass
yourself off as a native speaker of a particular
land, provided that you know the language.
Misdirection
Prerequisite. 13th level
You can sometimes cause another creature to
suffer an attack meant for you. When you are
targeted by an attack while a creature within
5 feet of you is granting you cover against
that attack, you can use your reaction to have
the attack target that creature instead of you.
Mutilate Strike
Whenever you can attack as a bonus action
with an off-hand weapon, you may instead
add the off-hand damage to your main attack
action, while retaining your bonus action.
Your bonus action cannot be used to attack
the same round after using this strike. Once
used, this talent cannot be used again for
three rounds.
Natural Explorer (Favored Terrain)
You are particularly familiar with one type of
natural environment and are adept at
traveling and surviving in such regions.
Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic,
coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain,
swamp, or caves and underground. When
you make an Intelligence or Spirit check
related to your favored terrain, your
proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using
a skill that you‘re proficient in. This ability
works on any plane so long as it has a terrain
of comparable nature (desert covers both
Tanaris in Azeroth and Outland‘s Hellfire
Peninsula).
While traveling for an hour or more in your
favored terrain, you gain the following
benefits:
 Difficult terrain doesn‘t slow your
group‘s travel
 Your group can‘t become lost except
by magical means
 Even when you are engaged in
another activity while traveling (such
as foraging, navigating, or tracking),
you remain alert to danger, and have
advantage to checks to avoid being
surprised in your favored terrain
 You have advantage to saving throws
against natural hazards in your
favored terrain.
 You can move stealthily at your
normal pace without slowing down
 When you forage or gather, you find
twice as much food as you normally
would
 While tracking other creatures, you
also learn their exact number, their
sizes, and how long ago they passed
through the area
You may switch an existing favored terrain by
performing all the following tasks, focused on
one terrain:
 Track a target or explore the area for
at least one hour alone;
 Spend 7 days in the terrain;
 Hunt down and defeat one native
creature (though you do not have to
defeat it alone).
This talent can be taken multiple times, each
time adding one favored terrain mastered at a
given time.
Primeval Alertness
Prerequisite. Proficiency in Stealth
Whenever you are subjected to an effect that
attempts to detect or identify you (such as a
scrying spell), you gain advantage to all saving
throws versus such effects. If you succeed on
a contested Spirit saving throw, you can also
reverse the spell (if possible, gaining a
momentary glimpse of who is attempting to
scry on you).
Primeval Awareness
Prerequisite. requires the ability to cast the
detect magic spell by using mana
You gain awareness of your environment on
a local scale. You can use your action and
expend mana equal to any spell to gain
primeval awareness. For 1 minute per level of
the spell you expended, you can sense
whether the following types of creatures are
present within 1 mile of you (or within up to
6 miles if you are in your favored terrain, are
on high ground compared to them, or if the
target is a favored enemy): aberrations,
celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends,
and undead.
This feature doesn‘t reveal the creatures‘
location or number, but does hint at their
strength in rough terms (weaker, equal to
you, or stronger than you, more numerous
than you, wounded) and their general
direction.
Primeval Disruption
Prerequisite. Primeval Awareness talent, and
one of the two: 5th level or the ability to cast
detect magic
You can sense if a favored enemy is casting a
divine or arcane spell (choose one upon
gaining this talent) within 3 miles. You are
also aware of their general direction. If the
target is within 1 mile, you can spend a
reaction to force them to roll a Spirit saving
throw against being distracted. This ability
can be used a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus before replenishing after a
long rest. If there are multiple favored
enemies within the radius, you get a general
awareness of them, but cannot force a
disruption, unless you are the closest creature
to the target.
Reckless Attack
When you make your first attack on your
turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.
Doing so gives you advantage on melee attack
rolls using Strength on this turn, but attack
rolls against you have advantage until your
next turn.
Relentless
Prerequisite. 5th level
If you drop to 0 hit points and don't die
outright, you can make a DC 10 Stamina
saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1
hit point instead. Each time this is used, you
increase the DC by 5 points. The DC resets
once you complete a short rest. This is
known as cheat death by hunters and rogues.
Reliable Talent
Prerequisite. 5th level, 1 level in Rogue
Whenever you make an ability check that lets
you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat
a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
Retaliation
Prerequisite. 9th level
When you take damage from a creature that
is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
reaction to make a melee weapon attack
against that creature. This ability can be used
a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, with the uses replenishing after a
short rest. This is also sometimes known as
counterattack or storm of blades by hunters
and rogues, respectively.
Second Wind
Prerequisite. Must be taken at 1st level of
Warrior
You have a limited well of stamina you can
draw upon to protect yourself from harm.
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to
regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your
warrior level. Once you use this feature, you
must finish a short or long rest before you
can use it again.
Shockwave
Prerequisite. 1 level in Warrior
You slam your weapon (manufactured or
natural) into the ground, creating a ripple of
force that shoots outward. This deals damage
equal to your weapon damage, and affects a
line 5-foot thick and 30 feet long. All
creatures in the area in contact with the
ground or within 5 feet of it that succeed on
an Agility saving throw take half damage. The
terrain damaged becomes difficult terrain
(such as rubble) if applicable. If you have
extra attacks, you may spend them to add the
minimum possible damage to your total.
Once this talent is used, it cannot be used
again until after a short rest.
Shock Resistant
Prerequisite. 1 level in Monk or Warrior
You are more resilient against effects that
would otherwise shock or stun a normal
creature. You have advantage to saving
throws against any effect that would cause the
stunned condition. If an effect causes the
condition as a secondary effect, the advantage
applies only against the condition.
Shout
Prerequisite. 1 level in Warrior
You can channel your warrior spirit into
powerful battlefield commands (called
shouts), although it can be anything from a
barking command, to a litany, a prayer, or
even a song. You can give a number of shouts
equal to your Stamina or Charisma modifier
(choose one). Using a shout costs a bonus
action, and you may maintain an active shout
for until the end of your turn in the next
round with another bonus action (up to 1
minute). This bonus action still allows you to
use strike effects (as if it does not cost an
action), but does not allow other abilities.
Shouts have a range of 30 feet of the range of
the spell specified.
Shouts can replicate certain auras or have an
entirely unique effect.
 Battle Shout. You cast the
abandonment aura spell.
 Defensive Shout. You cast the devotion
aura spell.
 Disruptive Shout (requires 7th level).
You cast the distraction aura spell.
 Halting. One target within range has
their speed halved. You can use this
shout as a reaction.
 Invigorating. You may activate this
shout by maintaining it for three
rounds against a single target within
range. At the start of your turn on
the fourth round, the target increases
their maximum hit points by onehalf your level for one hour (cannot
exceed double their maximum hit
points), or can spend a single healing
dice to heal themselves.
 Marching Orders (requires 5th level).
You cast the crusader aura spell.
 Rallying. One target within range is
affected as if you cast the heroism
spell (treat your Stamina modifier as
the relevant spellcasting modifier).
Maintaining the shout maintains the
spell (up to the spell‘s normal limit).
 Reordering. One target within range
can move up to one-quarter their
speed as their reaction. You can
change the target of this shout by
maintaining it.
 Taunt. You cast the compelled duel
spell. You can choose an additional
target for the spell for every two
levels above 5th.
 Terrifying Howl. You cast the cause fear
spell. You can choose an additional
target for the spell for every two
levels above 5th.
 Startling Cry. One target within range
suffers disadvantage to their attack
rolls. You can activate this shout as a
reaction if the attack takes place
outside your turn, and you may
maintain it on your turn and choose
another target. A creature cannot be
affected by this ability more than
once until it completes a short rest.
This is a fear effect.
If the target of a shout leaves the range or is
defeated, the effect ends for them. If a
creature is affected by a shout used by you, or
succeeds on their saving throw against it, they
cannot be affected again by the same shout
until after one minute. A shout is a thunder
effect that does not function in areas of
silence or if you cannot vocalize.
Special. If you have proficiency in musical
instruments, you can use them to apply a
bonus to your shouts appropriate to the
musical instrument type.
 Brass (trumpet, cornet, tuba). Clarion.
Any saving throw done against your
active spells, or any attempts to
dispel your spells channeled through
a brass instrument suffer
disadvantage (if the dispel would be
automatic, it instead requires a check
regardless of spell level).
 Percussion (drums, triangle, bells).
Resonance. The range of your spells
channeled through your instrument
increases by 50%.
 Strings (violin, cello, harp, dulcimer).
Lingering. If you cast a noninstantaneous spell and stop
concentrating or channeling it, it
lingers for 1d4 rounds after you stop
concentrating or channeling. This
cannot exceed the maximum
duration of the spell, but can allow
you to effectively maintain multiple
auras or concentration spells.
 Woodwinds (flutes, clarinet, ocarina).
Synthesized. If you cast a spell that
provides a bonus to a roll or
advantage to it, the targets gain a
further +1 bonus to the roll.
Slayer’s Counter
Prerequisite. 17th level and Slayer‘s Prey
You gain the ability to counterattack when
your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target
of your Slayer‘s Prey forces you to make a
saving throw, you can use your reaction to
make one weapon attack against the quarry.
You make this attack immediately before
making the saving throw. If your attack hits,
your save automatically succeeds, in addition
to the attack‘s normal effects.
Slayer’s Prey
Prerequisite. 1 level in Hunter
You can focus your ire on one foe, increasing
the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action,
you designate one creature you can see within
60 feet of you as the target of this feature.
The first time each turn that you hit that
target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra
1d6 damage from the weapon. Once the
creature is defeated, you can choose another
target.
Slippery Mind
Prerequisite. 13th level, 1 level in Rogue or
Monk
You have acquired greater mental strength.
You gain proficiency in Spirit saving throws.
If you are a monk, you gain proficiency in all
saving throws instead.
Slow Fall
You can use your reaction when you fall to
reduce any falling damage you take by an
amount equal to five times your level. If you
would have landed on a target of an attack
you would make, you may deal extra damage
equal to half the amount of fall damage
reduced by this talent, provided you succeed
on the attack roll. In some circles, this ability
is known as a drop kick. This extra damage is
a strike effect.
Stalker’s Flurry
Prerequisite. 9th level, 1 level in Hunter
You learn to attack with such unexpected
speed that you can turn a miss into another
attack. When you miss with a weapon attack,
you can make another weapon attack as part
of the same action. This can be done a
number of times equal to your Strength or
Agility modifier before requiring a short rest.
Stunning Slam
Upon scoring a critical hit with a melee
weapon, you can stun your target for until
the end of your turn in the next round. This
can be negated with a successful Stamina
saving throw. This is a strike effect.
Suffused Arrows
Prerequisite. 1 level in Hunter
You master the art of spell-casting through
arrows or infusing them. You may choose to
gain proficiency in the Infusion Kit, but can
only infuse ranged weapons or arrows, or
gain the Spell Strike feat (but only for ranged
weapons). If you choose to gain proficiency
with the kit, you start with three infusion
matrices of your choice that you can craft,
and may store them in infusion manuals or
similar books.
Despite the talent‘s name, this can also cover
other types of ranged weapons and
ammunition, such as crossbow bolts and
bullets, as well as larger samples (such as
ballistae bolts or cannonballs).
Swift Slash
Whenever you use the Dash action, you may
make one free melee attack with a finesse
weapon, made at any point during
movement. This attack is treated as a normal
melee attack for all purposes, but is resolved
with a -2 penalty to hit.
If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points as part
of this attack, you benefit from the blur spell
until the beginning of your turn in the next
round. You can use this talent only once per
round, even if you had an ability that allowed
multiple Dash actions in one round (such as
Cunning Action or Haste).
Tempered Hunter
Prerequisite. Favored Enemy
You have advantage versus divine or arcane
spells (choose one upon gaining this talent)
cast by your favored enemies and advantage
to all checks to avoid being subject to the
scrying spell, or being detected, or identified
by similar magic. Magics of such type also cast
by your favored enemies cannot be used to
put you to sleep or to read your mind.
Terrifying Tracker
Prerequisite. 5th level
Whenever you succeed on tracking a creature
and have them within your line of sight, you
gain advantage to any contested skill check
against them. You may also intimidate the
target without revealing yourself (usually to
steer the target into one place or another).
Thunder Clap
You may use your action to cast the
thunderstorm spell by slamming your weapon
into the ground, releasing a wave of force.
This acts as the spell with the following
differences:
 The spell deals normal damage, plus
your weapon damage roll. If you have
extra attacks, you can add +5 to the
damage roll for each attack you
would normally make beyond the
first.
 You can change its area to a 15-foot
sphere centered on you, excluding
yourself (and a number of targets
equal to your Strength modifier)
from the damage.
 Targets who fail their saving throw
are chilled for one minute. A
creature may repeat its saving throw
at the end of its turn every round to
end the condition. You may choose
to push the targets as the normal
spell instead.
This is a supernatural ability. Once this
ability is used, it cannot be used again until
after a short rest.
Tremor
Prerequisite. Strength of 15 or higher
You may use a bonus action to cause a small
localized tremor (usually by stomping your
foot or slamming your fist down), dealing
your unarmed strike damage in a 5-foot
sphere centered on you, halved on an Agility
save. Those who fail the saving throw are also
knocked prone. If you have a natural
weapon, you can use it to determine the
damage you deal instead. If you use this
ability at the end of a Heroic Leap, you may
add +5 to the total damage.
This talent can be used a number of times
equal to your proficiency bonus before
replenishing after a short rest.
Tricks of the Trade
You may cast the compelled duel spell, but
instead of drawing the target to you, you can
direct them to a secondary target within 30
feet of both of you. The target of the spell has
advantage to the saving throw unless the
secondary creature is one of your allies or is
neutral to both of you. After being used, this
cannot be used again until after a short rest.
This effect ends if you attack the target, if the
third creature does not defend itself, or if you
end your turn more than 30 feet away from
the target. If the target defeats the secondary
target, you regain use of this ability.
This talent can be taken multiple times, each
time adding another two uses of this ability
before a short rest.
Umbral Sight
You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
If you already have darkvision from your race,
its range increases by 30 feet. While in
darkness, you can hide in plain sight against
any creature that relies on darkvision to see
you in that darkness.
Unarmored Movement
Your speed increases by five feet per
proficiency bonus you have while you are not
wearing armor or wielding a shield. This
talent can be chosen again at level 5 or
higher, allowing you to move along vertical
surfaces and across liquids on your turn
without falling during the move so long as
you benefit from the speed increase.
Uncanny Dodge
Prerequisite. 5th level, 1 level in Rogue or
Monk
When an attacker that you can see hits you
with an attack, you can use your reaction to
halve the attack‘s damage against you.
Unerring Eye
Prerequisite. 13th level
Your senses are almost impossible to foil. As
an action, you sense the presence of illusions,
creatures not in their original form (such as
shapechangers), and other magic designed to
deceive the senses within 30 feet of you,
provided you aren‘t blinded or deafened. You
sense that an effect is attempting to trick you,
but you gain no insight into what is hidden
or into its true nature. This ability can be
used a number of times equal to your Spirit
modifier before replenishing after a long rest.
Wind Walk
Prerequisite. 1 level in Monk or Warrior
You may use your action to wind-walk,
rendering yourself invisible as per the
invisibility spell, and increase your land speed
by 10 feet. Unlike normal stances, you must
continue moving (at least half your speed) or
else this effect dissipates. Your first attack
while performing Wind Walk is a critical hit,
and ends the invisibility effect. This is a
supernatural ability. Once this talent is used,
it cannot be used again until after a short
rest.

## Character Details

<a id="characterdetails"></a>

### Standard Languages

<a id="languages"></a>

___

1 Gutterspeech is often known as the language of the forsaken, and is a dialect of Common
influenced by dwarven, low common, and a hint of Thieves‘ Cant. Any creature that knows one
component language of Gutterspeech can learn it with half the normal time of learning a language.
___
2 Demons of the Burning Legion speak the tongue of their kind, Eredun, which is a perversion of
Titan using their own script. Any creature that is not also a fiend that deliberately speaks Eredun
without being also bound to demons, must make a Spirit save every year (DC 15) or lose 1 point of
Spirit, and shift one step towards Lawful Evil. If the character is Evil, the spirit loss remains until
the character pledges themselves to the Burning Legion or a representative of them, such as by
Calling them or serving them in a substantial way, in which case the attribute is restored.
This is a Curse effect, and the Remove Curse removes this penalty forever. Characters who gain
access to Eredun through special abilities (such as the warlock or demon hunter) do not suffer from
this curse, although ones gained by training or by background do.
___
3 The elven tongue remains remarkably unchanged throughout the centuries, but many dialects
have been born. Darnassian is spoken by night elves. A dialect of Darnassian is spoken by the
Nightborne (known as Shalassian). Thalassian is spoken by Highborne, high elves, void elves, and
blood elves. Nazja is spoken by naga. A debased sub-dialect of Nazja is Nerglish, the speech of
murlocs.
___
4 Kalimag has four distinct dialects for the prime elementals, such as Aquan for water elementals,
Auran for air elementals, Ignan for fire elementals, and Terran for earth elementals.
___
5 Low Common is often spoken by furbolgs, gnolls, kobolds, ogres, and most humanoids or giants
with low Intelligence. It is also an easier language to learn, requiring only one-quarter the normal
learning time.
___
6 Orcish script is relatively new, and before adopting Common, they used pictograms (as Taur-ahe
uses today).
___
7 The troll tongue is curiously close to Common. Knowing Common can learn Troll is one half the
normal time of learning a language.

### Inspiration

<a id="inspiration"></a>

Inspiration is a rule the player can use to
grant them benefits for playing their
character in a way that‘s true to his or her
personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw
(collectively known as personality). By using
inspiration, you can draw on a personality
trait (compassion for the downtrodden) to
give you an edge in negotiating with the
Beggar Prince.

#### Gaining Inspiration
Gaining inspiration occurs when a character
gives in to a flaw, reaffirms a bond, or
otherwise suffers a narrative or mechanical
penalty due to their personality (also known
as a Setback).

A rogue with the flaw „I'm always in debt. I
spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries
faster than I bring them in‟ can invoke it when
attempting to negotiate a favor. In this case,
the DM may rule that the opposing character
recognizes the character's flaw, and does not
trust the character enough to aid them,
thereby depriving them of a helpful ally and
forcing them to find another one or to make
due without aid.

Any mechanical penalties must be equivalent
to the benefit of inspiration, such as granting
an enemy inspiration or disadvantage on a
necessary skill check or saving throw.

A character may also gain inspiration after
suffering a setback (such as losing a loved one
who was their bond, or betraying their ideal
out of necessity or bitterness). If this occurs, a
character may choose to change one of their
traits, ideals, or bonds. By doing so, a
character develops, and the character has
another point of Inspiration (up to a
maximum of 2).

#### Spending Inspiration
When inspired, a character can gain a bonus
to performing actions that fit their traits,
support their ideals, or aid their bonds. A
character with inspiration may spend it to
gain one of the following effects.
* Advantage to a single saving throw,
  ability check, or attack roll.

\pagebreakNum

* Roll a 1d6, and add the result to one d20
  roll or your AC against one attack. You
  may declare this after you know the
  result of the attack.
* Impose disadvantage to a single saving
  throw, ability check, or attack roll of a
  creature attacking you.

#### Special Inspiration
Upon hearing of the murder of his brother
Muradin, King Magni Bronzebeard was
inspired to forge Ashbringer, a blade he
would have otherwise been unable to create.

It was Mannoroth‘s taunt to Garrosh
Hellscream that provoked him into a terrible
fury, allowing him to land a blow that slew
the demon king of the pit lords.

A DM may allow spending Inspiration for a
special benefit, such as temporary access to a
feat (such as Infusionist) for one task or
encounter, crafting an artifact, regaining a
use of an ability with no remaining uses
(Berserker Rage), or another appropriate
effect.

#### Personality
It is always advisable to consult with the DM
and other players on how your traits, ideals,
bonds, and flaws synchronize with one
another and your character concept, and to
ensure that your character's personality is
distinct enough to gain and spend inspiration
reliably in situations where they are the
narrative 'stars'. At the same time, it should
be infrequent enough to not prove disruptive
to normal gameplay (such as choosing to take
a setback for inspiration).

If you play a mage, for example, you may
choose to adopt the background of a scholar
and choose the following personality.
___
**Trait.** I'm used to helping out those who
aren‘t as smart as I am, and I patiently
explain anything and everything to
others.
<br>
**Ideal.** Knowledge. The path to power
and self-improvement is through
knowledge.
<br>
**Bond.** I've been searching my whole life
for the answer to a certain question.
<br>
**Flaw.** I can‘t keep a secret to save my life,
or anyone else‘s.
___
The aspects of the mage's personality
synchronize well. If you allow a critical secret
to slip (flaw), risking an ally's career or life,
you gain Inspiration, which can possibly be
used to answer a question you spent your
whole life studying (Bond).
If your ally loses their career or possibly even
their life, your character is traumatized
enough to warrant character development,
changing your ideal from knowledge to either
power (Knowledge is the path to power and
domination) or friendship (depending on
how you wish to handle the character‘s
personality progression).

## Backgrounds

<a id="backgrounds"></a>

The Warcraft universe has its own native twist on backgrounds. You may use any of the below
backgrounds with the appropriate customization options.

### Acolyte

<a id="acolyte"></a>

You are a religious devotee. Acolytes tend to
live somewhat sheltered lives as priests and
aides in major religions, until the call to
adventure sounds. Acolytes serving in the
Church of the Holy Light are most common,
but there are also other faiths with
established hierarchies, such as the Troll faith
in the Loa.

#### Variant Acolyte: Cultist
You have dedicated your life (and very soul)
to the service of a cult. This could be
anything from a benign splinter organization
away from the main church of the Holy Light
to the dark Cult of the Damned, various
demon cults (such as with many orcish clans),
the Cult of Shadow, among others. With this
variant, you are trained in hiding your faith
and loyalties from others. You may also be
part of the Shadow Council, venerating the
Old Gods.

Rather than training in Insight and Religion,
you may exchange one of the proficiencies
with Deception or Intimidation.

#### Variant Acolyte: Sister of Elune
You are part of the Sisterhood of Elune, a
matriarchal religious/military organization
that holds great sway in Night Elven society.

The sisterhood is the gateway of a night elven
sister joining the priesthood of Elune
(becoming a Priestess of the Moon), or a
member of the Watchers organization. Elite
Watchers are elevated to being Wardens,
legendary jailors of the enemies of Night
Elven society.

Rather than training in Insight and Religion,
you may exchange one of the proficiencies
with Stealth. Also, rather than having 5 sticks
of incense, you instead have an insignia of
rank in the priesthood, and a bow of your
choice that was the tool of your training in
the favored weapon of the moon goddess.

### Charlatan

<a id="charlatan"></a>

You are a special sort of criminal who
specializes in taking advantage of others.
Charlatans tend to live in urbanized areas
where they have many marks (targets) and
areas where they can retreat if discovered.

Anyone can become a charlatan, but they are
common among human cities due to their
urban nature.

### Criminal

<a id="criminal"></a>

You are a criminal—who breaks the law for
fun and profit. Criminals come from every
walk of life and every type of environment,
and they range from petty thievery to outright
murder and assassinations.

#### Variant Criminal: Operative
You are part of a state or organization‘s
intelligence force. Operatives may belong to
the Stormwind‘s SI:7, the Defias
Brotherhood‘s operation cells, Ravenholdt,
the Shadow Council‘s eyes and ears, or the
Alterac Syndicate.

Operatives act in the shadows or in brief
flashes of activity to complete a critical
mission, before retreating to safe houses and
deliver their quarry, whether it be
information or proof of a kill.

#### Variant Criminal: Undead Deathstalker (Forsaken only)
You are part of the Forsaken Order of
Deathstalkers, an elite guard that also
doubles as a guild of assassins that serve the
Banshee Queen and her advisors.

Deathstalkers are skilled assassins who utilize
their undead nature in conducting
infiltrations and assassinations.

##### Deathstalker Test
Becoming a Deathstalker is a deadly mission
in of itself. The test given to prospective
Deathstalkers usually tests their patience,
cunning, or strength, and are tailored to
reveal the limits applicant‘s strengths and
how far they will go for the Banshee Queen
and the Forsaken.

\pagebreakNum

| d6  | Test |
|:---:|:----:|
| 1 | Assassinate an enemy (scarlet crusader, alliance spy, or a scourge necromancer) | 
| 2 | Track and apprehend infiltrators to Forsaken society or leadership | 
| 3 | Deliver a critical message through hostile territory | 
| 4 | Retrieve the head of a fallen Deathstalker agent | 
| 5 | Infiltrate, sabotage, or conduct reconnaissance on an enemy of the Forsaken |
| 6 | Guard an ally of the Forsaken against assassination without them realizing it | 

___
You may start with a dagger that doubles as a
signet of rank (called the Shadowstalker), and
one memento of your Deathstalker test.

##### Variant Feature (Undead Deathstalker): Undead Stalker
When conducting a mission, you intuitively
know how to utilize your undead nature for
best effect, recognizing and easily applying
unusual tactics such as waiting underwater
for hours before leaping out for a kill, staking
out a position for days or even weeks without
sleep, or tracking in hostile terrains without
tire or need to eat.

Furthermore, hidden agents loyal to the
Deathstalkers or the Forsaken recognize your
authority and influence, and they defer to
you if they are of a lower rank. You can
invoke your rank to exert influence over
other members and requisition simple
equipment or horses for temporary use. You
can also usually gain access to friendly
military encampments and fortresses where
your rank is recognized. Hidden shelters of
the Deathstalkers are found all over the
world in places where the Forsaken are
active.

#### Variant Criminal (Operative): Uncrowned
The Uncrowned is a secret society who claim
to be "the slayers of kings, the downfall of
empires, and the unseen blades that write the
true history of this world." Besides their role
as a secret society, the Uncrowned also guard
the world against the threats that seek to
destroy it to preserve their interests.

As part of the Uncrowned, you appear as a
member of any other faction in Azeroth, such
as a member of Ravenholdt, SI:7, or one of
the many pirate organizations (such as
Bloodsail Buccaneers).

##### Variant Feature (Operative): Agent of Suspect Loyalty
You are treated as a trusted member of two
or more organizations at once, serving two
intelligence organizations, one of which must
be the Uncrowned. The other organization
may know or be ignorant to the fact that you
are a double spy. If they are aware, they may
believe (due to your actions and decisions)
that they are playing the other agency, while
the Uncrowned believe the same. You have
the training to relax suspicions towards
actions that benefit one agency over another
when facing common agents of either
organizations.
As a double agent, your life is risky but
rewarding if you play your cards right—after
all, who knows your true loyalties but
yourself?

### Entertainer

<a id="entertainer"></a>

You are an actor, singer, dancer or other who
provides enjoyment through their
performances to others. Every culture enjoys
the entertainer‘s work.

#### Variant Entertainer: Darkmoon Theater Troupe Member
The Darkmoon Faire showcases the weird
and extraordinary once a month. Gathering
the exotic from around the world, Silas
Darkmoon presents the Darkmoon Faire as a
celebration of the wonders and mysteries
found in Azeroth. The faire spends most of
its time in parts unknown but is available
from time to time by accessing portals in
Elwynn Forest and Mulgore, which are
teleportation circles conjured by forces
(apparently) unknown to Darkmoon Isle.

It often takes three days to set up the new
attractions (from exotic vendors selling alien
mounts and magic item shops, to being
launched from the Darkmoon Cannon to
win tokens), and remains active for one
week—afterwards, the portals close, and the
faire goes on the move once more.<br><br>

> Ahead of You, Down the Path<br>
> A Majestic, Magical Faire!<br>
> Ignore the Darkened, Eerie Woods<br>
> Ignore the Eyes That Blink and Stare<br>
> <br>
> Fun & Games & Wondrous Sights!<br>
> Music & Fireworks to Light up the Night!<br>
> Do Not Stop! You're Nearly There!<br>
Behold, My Friend: THE DARKMOON FAIRE!<br>
> <br>
> -- Signs along the road to Darkmoon Faire

Besides the normal Entertainer Routines, you may refer to the list below for Darkmoon Faire Routines.

| d10  | Faire Routine |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1	| Fizzy Drink Vendor | 
| 2	| Crunchy Frog Cook | 
| 3	| Steam Tonk Scavenger | 
| 4	| Carnie Bandager | 
| 5	| Banner-maker | 
| 6	| Darkmoon Prize-Wrapper | 
| 7	| Race Manager | 
| 8	| Shooting Game Vendor | 
| 9	| Sweets Vendor | 
| 10 | Pet Tamer | 

### Folk Hero

<a id="folkhero"></a>

Before stepping onto the world stage, you
first saved a lone village near to your heart. A
Folk Hero may rise from anywhere he or she
is needed; wherever a monster pillages or a
child cries out, they‘ll be there.

Folk heroes arise from exceptional
circumstances. Many heroes of Azeroth
started as folk heroes, questing to resolve
family feuds in Elwynn to bringing closure to
widowed orcs of the Barrens.

\pagebreakNum

### Guild Artisan

<a id="guildartisan"></a>

You are a person of business. Artisans
learned a trade and practice it well, usually
accompanied by a union of like-minded
individuals.
Most artisans are found in large urban
settlements, offering training or
apprenticeship in the knowledge of how to
create rare materials. Many guilds exist in
Azeroth, such as the Alliance‘s MEGA
(Mechanical Engineering Guild, Associated),
and the Great Anvil Smiths of Ironforge, or
the independent (Goblin Experimental
Engineering Korporation).

#### Variant Guild Artisan: Company Owner
You may have chosen to start your own
enterprise over joining the employ of a guild
or company. This requires great initiative and
persistence, as other companies may wish to
force a merger to take advantage of your
innovations or to get rid of a competitor.

##### Variant Feature: Chief Executive Officer
Thanks to your initiative and ambition,
people are inclined to think the best of you
or take your word seriously. When entering a
market you are known in, people assume you
are there on serious business, from
investment to searching for apprentices to
even searching for a place to sell your wares.

The common folk make every effort to
accommodate you and avoid your
displeasure, and merchants and other
company owners treat you as an equal.
You can secure an audience with a local
merchant or company owner if you need to,
and with a little work, you might secure an
audience with a local noble as well, if you
have something they might like to listen to
(such as an offer to invest or useful products
of your making).

#### Variant Guild Artisan: Guild Crafter
Gnome and forsaken alchemists and
gnomish and dwarven tinkers often boast
membership in a guild that could support
their crafting endeavors, from providing
training in rare material recipes to financial
aid when a project becomes too expensive (in
return for a percent on future income, of
course!).

Furthermore, your guild may possess
engineering blueprints, alchemy formulae, or
even infusion matrices they might share with
you, in return for services rendered or for
reduced cost in comparison to other sources.

#### Variant Guild Artisan: Thorium Brother
The Thorium Brotherhood (TB Ltd.) is a
group of Dark Iron dwarves who are not
members of the Dark Iron clan. On the cliffs
overlooking the region called the Cauldron,
in the far north of the Searing Gorge, the
dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood have
established a base of operations, Thorium
Point. From here, they keep a close eye on
the Dark Iron dwarves' activities in the
Searing Gorge and beyond.

The Thorium Brotherhood comprises many
exceptionally talented craftsmen, and the
blacksmiths of the Brotherhood are rumored
to be among the finest Azeroth has ever seen.

They possess the knowledge required to make
the arms and armaments of Ragnaros, the
Fire Lord, but lack the manpower to obtain
the materials required for the crafting.

A daunting task, no doubt, but gaining access
to the Thorium Brotherhood's secrets should
prove to be a reward well worth the effort.

#### Variant Guild Merchant: Cartel Member
A cartel refers to a large group of goblin
traders. Goblin cartels often compete with
other cartels, such as in the Trade Wars.

These organizations are normally led by trade
princes, but they don't have to be; for
example, although the Venture Company is a
cartel, its leader Mogul Razdunk is not a
trade prince.

After the goblins overthrew the Zandalari
trolls, they celebrated their new found
freedom by turning on each other, creating
chaos as countless feuds were waged and
alliances formed. Soon enough they were
split into various different groups, with the
most powerful of these known as the cartels.

However, as the battles raged on and it
became clear no one was actually winning,
the cartels realized it was in their mutual
interests to broker a truce. Despite this, the
conflict would never really end, as the goblins
now turned to trade, doing battle in the
economic arena. For years to come the cartels
were rivals, constantly outshining and
outsmarting each other as they continued in
their quest for wealth and power.

As a cartel member, you do not create but
trade, and earn a living by maximizing profit
by selling to the neediest individuals or
organizations. You may use honorable means,
but there is no love lost between goblins and
the other races of Azeroth—establishing
monopolies, sabotaging the competition, and
selling basic living expenses are cutthroat
prices to starving buyers made trade princes
trade princes, after all!

Rather than proficiency with artisan‘s tools,
you might be proficient with navigator‘s
tools, a vehicle, or an additional language.

And instead of artisan‘s tools, you can start
with a mule and a cart, or a permanent free
pass on goblin balloons for yourself and your
adventuring companions.

### Haunted One

<a id="hauntedone"></a>

You have faced terrible darkness, and it has
left its mark on you. Haunted ones are born
from terrible circumstances, such as being
subject to demonic possession or the
influence of the Old Gods.

#### Variant Haunted One: Illidari
You are of the Illidari—the faction of Illidan
Stormrage, and you represent his will as part
of a force made of demon hunters and
warlocks. The Illidari also include demonic
forces that chose to serve him over the
Legion.

The most elite of Illidan's armies are his
demon hunter servitors, night elves and
blood elves trained to be the Betrayer's
mightiest enforcers, the bane of demonkind.

Zealously loyal to their master, the Illidari
demon hunters have a strong identity and a
close bond, although their heavy fel
corruption and demonic techniques have
inspired dread in their fellow elves.

You may replace your language with Eredun
(corrupted). You also start with a demon
hunter‘s pack instead of a monster hunter‘s
pack.

The demon hunter's pack includes a chest, a
crowbar, a hammer, a holy symbol (such of
Elune or the Holy Light), a flask of holy
water, a set of manacles, a silver mirror, a
flask of oil, a tinderbox, and three torches.

Purchasing the pack costs 33 gp, which is
cheaper than buying its contents individually.

Haunted One background (from Curse of
Strahd)

\pagebreakNum

### Hermit

<a id="hermit"></a>

You are a person who lives in isolation.
Hermits prefer the peace and quiet of
solitude to the bustle of towns and villages.
For whatever reason they have reentered
society once more.

#### Variant Hermit: Slumbering Druid (Druid only)
Druids of Azeroth are more attuned to the
world‘s dream-realm, the Emerald Dream,
than any other creature. The great Malfurion
Stormrage was in this slumber ever since the
War of the Ancients, nearly 10,000 years
before Orcs emerged on Azeroth, as well as
his fellow druids of many circles, such as the
Druids of the Talon, Druids of the Claw, and
Druids of the Antler.

Today, the Cenarion Circle consists of many
such hermit druids from many races, from
Night Elves to Tauren to Worgen, even to
the odd promising human or high elf
apprentice. The Cenarion Circle often
gathers at seasonal periods (such as solstices
and seasonal holy days) to discuss the issues
the world faces, from the spread of the
mysterious Emerald Nightmare to portents
and omens they notice during the Emerald
Sleep.

##### Variant Feature: Emerald Sleep
You can dream the Emerald Dream, a plane
of thought and fey, ruled by the great green
dragon Ysera and overseen by the demigod
Cenarius. It is a vast, ever-changing spirit
world that exists outside the boundaries of
the physical world.

While most creatures often tap into the
Emerald Dream while sleeping by accident,
you may enter it willingly whenever they
sleep, although you cannot shape anything
within it beyond a few moments.

Within the dream, you may call out the
spirit-form of another slumbering druid and
communicate with them, but only so long as
both you and they have been slumbering for
at least 6 hours. You can slumber even if you
normally do not need to sleep. While
sleeping, you can awaken in response to any
stimuli they specify.

Malfurion himself awoke only to answer the
clarion call of the Horn of Cenarius, blown
by his wife Tyrande Whisperwind in answer
to the Burning Legion descending on the
ancient forest of Ashenvale.
___
*Special.* If you are under the effects of the
slumber druid spell, you can remain in the
Emerald Dream so long as the spell is still
active.

### Noble

<a id="noble"></a>

You are an aristocrat or important member
of society. Nobles exist in all societies, even if
they aren‘t legally defined as such. There is
always a cultural, spiritual, or economic elite
in every civilization, regardless of the title
itself.

You may be a noble of the Stormwind House
of Nobles, dissatisfied with the role the
Alliance has or your fellow nobles (egged on
by nobles such as Lady Prestor), or a high
tribesman in orcish society. While few night
elven nobles have remaining grievances after
they witnessed the folly of Queen Azshara
during the War of the Ancients, some do
long for the days where they ruled and the
Sisterhood of Elune and the Druids were not
calling the shots.

Where the nobles of Alterac turned to serve
or join the criminal Syndicate, high elven
noble refugees have decided to fight back for
their homelands.

#### Variant Noble: Knight
There are many knightly orders on Azeroth,
from the noble Knights of Stormwind and
the remnants of the Silver Hand, to the
Argent Dawn or Scarlet Crusade orders.

Orcish raiders also have a position of
importance in the Horde and in their tribes,
often serving as advisors and councilors as
well as generals and commanders.

##### Variant Feature: Mounted Warrior
Instead of taking the Position of Privilege or
Retainers feature, you may instead acquire a
racial mount appropriate for your race (such
as a horse for humans, a riding wolf for orcs,
etc.).

#### Variant Noble: Tribal Elite
You are an elite member of your tribe. Many
tribes of dozens of races spread among
Azeroth, such as the various troll and orc
clans.
Instead of receiving a signet ring, you have a
symbol or flag of your clan.

##### Variant Feature: Rite of Glory
You passed many trials, such as the rite of
adulthood and rite of glory. Your clan (and
others) acknowledge your authority and
influence, and you may utilize this influence
to secure simple equipment such as
temporary mounts or equipment. You are
also honored by your clan, and you and your
adventuring companions can find it easy to
acquire shelter and food as guests, so long as
you observe the customs of hospitality.

### Outlander

<a id="outlander"></a>

You are a survivor of the wilderness. An
outlander, like the hermit, tends to live alone
though not exclusively. They live in the wilds
for years at a time away from greater
civilization. They live off the land and survive
using their wits.

Every race has its members who chose to live
apart from urban civilization.

#### Variant Outlander: Headhunter (Troll only)
You are capable combatant and survivalist
who serves himself or his tribe, walking the
wilderness and putting down threats to your
people while living far from them. This could
be for noble or spiritual reasons.

Instead of proficiency in a musical
instrument, you may be proficient with one
artisan tool of your choice or the herbalism
kit. You can also replace your staff with an
herbalism kit.

#### Variant Outlander: Spirit Walker (Tauren and Orc only)
You are a spirit walker, a mystical, whitefurred tauren. Believed to be the ill omen of
a coming age, white tauren are held in near
reverence by their people, often becoming
reclusive priests who wander the land in
search of kindred spirits. Spirit walkers
maintain balance between the world of the
living and the spirit realm.

As a spirit walker, your fur is pearly-white,
and your eyes reflect the life of a thousand
souls.

Their bodies are vessels, conduits from the
realm of the dead to the world of the living.

As a spirit walker, you are often looked upon
with awe and fear by their brethren. A spirit
walker strong enough to bear the weight of so
many souls achieves a mystical
transcendence, embodying the collective will
and experience of the generations that are
reaching out to him.

\pagebreakNum

Alternatively, instead of being a tauren, you
might be an orc from the Shattered Hand
clan.

#### Variant Feature: Conduit of Spirits
You are capable of channeling ancestral
spirits through your body. When you sleep or
meditate, you often receive visions of the
people who are now dead, usually echoes of
the past. If there are restless spirits about, the
DM may allow a limited degree of contact
with them (as a Call), as if you shared a
language with incorporeal undead. This
communication takes five times as much time
to deliver or understand a message.

Uncontrolled undead that normally hostile
by nature might approach with caution or
ignore you, instead of attacking on sight.

Because this feature is not magical, its power
is inferior to the speak with dead spell or
actually speaking a shared language.

### Sage

<a id="sage"></a>

You are a scholar of mystic or mundane
knowledge. Sages are a class of learners who
delve into the deepest mysteries and the
murkiest of Apocrypha to bring truth to the
people, or a sizeable grant to their
institutions.

#### Variant Sage: Kirin Tor Agent
You are (or were) employed in Dalaran,
whether an agent of the mage-court itself, a
graduate, a mage-guard, or one of the factions
that rule the city. The magical city of Dalaran
is ruled by a council of mages, and is usually influenced by the interests of several factions.
By the time of the Third War, there were
many powerful wizards‘ guilds, who trained
apprentices and served as a curious mix of
faction, guild, and students‘ activities clubs.

By the time of the War of the Lich King, the
Sunreavers and Silver Covenant factions
dominated the political scene.

You may replace one skill proficiency from
your background with Deception,
Investigation, or Persuasion. Instead of
common clothes, your clothes might be violet
(representing the kingdom itself), or be of a
color associated with one of the guilds. Also,
you gain one of the following equipment
depending on your role in Dalaran: a
graduate‘s staff (if you were a graduate) or a
signet ring of a faction (if you were a faction
member).

### Sailor

<a id="sailor"></a>

You are a sailor, one who makes their way in
the world as traders, merchants, naval
personnel, or even as smugglers or pirates
when times get lean. Sailors can be found
near any major body of water or in ports.

#### Variant Sailor: Goblin Balloonist (usually Goblin only)
The job of a balloonist is a risky but
profitable venture in the world of Azeroth, as
it is gradually becoming the medium of
choice for transport across terrestrial lands.

As a balloonist, you may have faced high
winds, aerial foes, or delivered your charges
(or cargo) across active battlefields to their
destinations.

Instead of proficiency in vehicles (water), you
may be proficient in vehicles (air).

##### Variant Feature: Goblin Balloon Pass
When you need to, you can secure free
passage on a goblin balloon for yourself and
your adventuring companions. You might
sail on the balloon you served on, or another
balloon you have good relations with
(perhaps one captained by a former
crewmate). Because you‘re calling in a favor, you can‘t be certain o f a schedule or route
that will meet your every need. Your
Dungeon Master will determine how long it
takes to get where you need to go. In return
for your free passage, you and your
companions are expected to assist the crew
during the voyage, but you do not require a
permanent pass.

#### Variant Sailor: Mariner or Reaver
Marines (or mariners) are, depending on
their faction, either footmen or grunts
specialized in the support of naval and army
operations on land and at sea.

As a mariner, may have served aboard the
various airships and gunships of the Alliance
or the Horde, and are often working
alongside sailors. The human nation of
Kul‘tiras is specialized in naval warfare and as
such has a high number of marines among its
forces. Mariners tend to operate under
standard five-year contracts when signing on
with a new crew as evidenced by the crew of
the Wavestrider. While human marines are
almost always found among the crews of
Alliance gunships, it seems the orcish
equivalent for them is "reaver", for reavers
can be found among almost all orc gunships.

Instead of a lucky charm, you may choose to
receive an insignia of rank instead.

### Soldier

<a id="soldier"></a>

You are a combatant who participated in a
war or trained as such. With war being the
fact of life in Azeroth, there is no end in sight
for work, whether it be for a militia,
professional standing army, or as a
mercenary.

#### Variant Soldier: Militiaman
You are trained in a town militia, practicing
weaponry common to your race and ready at
a moment‘s notice to answer the call to arms.

##### Variant Feature: Call to Arms
You answer to the call to arms—and give it as
well. Villagers, militiamen, city-folk, and city
guards usually trust your word regarding any danger you identify and properly
communicate, and you can temporarily
acquire equipment that can aid confront the
threat from them, such as mounts or
weapons. Your background and steadfastness
also usually allows such strangers to be
friendlier to you so long as you maintain your
duties.

#### Variant Soldier: Mage Guard
You are trained to guard and protect mages
or other spellcasters. You could have been
trained in the Violet City of Dalaran, have
been cloistered with the priests of Northshire
Abbey, or have been a childhood friend or
sibling to a mage.

Rather than training in Athletics and
Intimidation, you may exchange one of the
proficiencies with Arcana or Investigation.

##### Variant Feature: Special Investigator
You are trained in taking down wizards and
finding evidence of them. You could have
been trained in Dalaran by the Kirin Tor‘s
wardens, or be a superstitious villager who
fears dark magic.

\pagebreakNum

Whenever you visit a settlement, commoners
and law enforcement are more likely to trust
you with reports of strange events, such as
missing persons, reports of demonic activity,
unknown magical paraphernalia such as
magic circles burnt into grass, or reports of
people speaking in tongues.

While many such instances were pranks or
the confused spellcasting or apprentice
mages, some are omens of darker things. You
can also usually tell the difference between
the two when observing clues, such as a
suspect‘s residence.

You are usually recommended to keep the
results of your investigation secret and report
back to your superiors.

#### Variant Soldier: Crusader
A crusade was the only answer to humanity
in the fallen domains of Lordaeron and
Dalaran. The undead armies of the Scourge
were a tide that could not be pushed back
save by the sword and the prayer.

You might have once been a member of the
disbanded Order of the Silver Hand, a
farmer who threw down his farming tools
and took up a rusted militia sword, or a
youth who chose to leave the safety of the
southern lands to fight back against the
encroaching darkness under the mantle of
the Light. Not every crusader is from the
Paladin class, as they also boast Hunters and
Priests among their rank, as well as the
necessary Rogue.

You may replace one skill proficiency from
your background with Insight or Religion.

#### Variant Soldier: Farstrider (High Elf and Blood Elf usually)
You are part of the High Elven Order of
Farstriders, a paramilitary organization that is
a similar reflection to the night elven
Sentinels. After the destruction of
Quel‘Thalas, the Farstriders began
diminishing in importance, especially after
the blood elves‘ newfound obsession with fel
magic.

Rangers form the scout and advanced
skirmishing forces of Quel‘Thalas, while
seekers are specialized assassins who infiltrate
enemy lands and perform dangerous
missions.

You may replace one skill proficiency from
your background with Nature, Insight, or
Perception. Also, instead of proficiency with
vehicles (land), you may gain proficiency with
an herbalism or disguise kit.

##### Variant Feature: Wanderer
You may gain the wanderer background
feature of the Outlander instead of the
Military Rank feature of the soldier
background.

#### Variant Soldier: Sentinel
You are part of the Night Elven Order of
Sentinels, a religious/military organization
that protects and preemptively destroys
threats to the night elves and their lands.

You may replace one skill proficiency from
your background with Religion,
Investigation, or Stealth.

### Urchin

<a id="urchin"></a>

A child of the streets. Urchins can be found
in the dirty streets begging for coin,
pocketing what isn‘t theirs, and generally
trying to grow up to be criminals or
charlatans.

#### Variant Urchin: Refugee
In many cases, an urchin could have been
born in comfort or even opulence. You have
been forced from your home to another land,
either from war (such as the humans of
Stormwind or the high elves of Silvermoon),
disease (such as the humans of southern
Lordaeron escaping the Undead Plague), civil
conflict (such as the instability in Westfall),
or the very destruction of your world (as the
Mag‘har orcs).

##### Variant Feature: Something Left Behind
You have access to a unique and powerful
secret. The exact nature of this secret
depends on the nature of your exile or status
as refugee. It may be a secret about the event
that caused you to escape, knowledge of a
treasure or valuable memento. It might be
information that would be damaging to the
organization that drove you away, and hence
the reason for your choice to adventure.

Work with your DM to determine the details
of your secret and its impact on the
campaign.

# Chapter 5: Equipment

<a id="startingequipment"></a>

## Starting Equipment
As described in the Player’s Handbook, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists in the equipment chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing.

<a id="wealth"></a>

## Wealth
Material wealth in Azeroth was based on gold, silver, and copper coins. In many cases, however, barter takes place (such as in Booty Bay or other goblin strongholds), or is measured in other means (land, ownership of mines and other resource nodes, etc.)

Stormwind's coinage has traditionally been the copper penny, the silver groat, and the gold sovereign. For all purposes, however, coinage is nearly universal, with Stormwind-minted coin in equal circulation with coins minted in Ironforge, Orgrimmar, or Booty Bay. The Defias Brotherhood enjoys marring Stormwind minted coins creating "cross-eyed coins” which is a sign of treason to the throne.

Mined from the rich earth of Azeroth and Lordaeron, gold is commonly used as coins in exchange for goods and services. As a rare substance that is always in short supply, gold must be dug out from the rock and soil within established gold mines. Many of these mines were abandoned when the orc raids began (followed by the First and Second wars) and the workers fled for their very lives.

Since the beginning of the Second War, many gold-mining sites are frequently operated while under the protection of military forces.

Goblins call their currency macaroons, and they refer to money as moolah.

Some other coins that are not minted any longer are worth more to some people. Gold coins from the fall of the Night Elf empire (Azshara-mint) often worth at least ten times the actual value of the same coin at the time of the empire’s fall and drowning beneath the sea.

### Starting Wealth by Class

| Class  | Funds |
|:---:|:---:|
| Alchemist	| 5d4 x 10 gp <br>(plus 250 gp worth in alchemical components) | 
| Death Knight | 5d4 x 10 gp (plus Runeblade(s)) | 
| Druid | 2d4 x 10 gp | 
| Hunter | 5d4 x 10 gp | 
| Mage | 4d4 x 10 gp |

| Tinker | 4d4 x 10 gp <br>(plus 250 gp worth in engineering components) | 
| Warlock | 4d4 x 10 gp | 
| Warrior | 5d4 x 10 gp | 

### Coinage
The monetary system in the world of Warcraft operates on the scale described in the Player’s Handbook.  The only exception is that platinum pieces have yet to make an appearance in the world of Azeroth; though the value of platinum is recognized, it is rare enough that it is still used primarily as a decorative material rather than a type of coinage.

### Instances

| 1 copper | was asked of Lo'Gosh and his companions by an old woman in Menethil Harbor in exchange for telling them their fortune. |

### Selling Treasure
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

#### Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment
As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell. Those in pristine condition (newly made) can sell for their normal value.

#### Magic Items
Selling magic items is usually problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Major cities and faction capitals often have one or more shops (or institutions) that hire and retain professional infusionists. Such infusionists are often tied to their trade, training institutions, or faction, and require a certain degree of respect or clout to trade with strangers. People who are friendly with such organizations (or the mother faction) can expect fair trade (in the instance of Stormwind, humans who are considered heroes are fairly traded with, while wandering Pandaren might not be trusted with valuable items).

#### Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects
These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

#### Trade Goods
On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

In many instances, going to larger towns (or those with greater commercial and economic activity) increases the chance of both selling treasure at fair prices as well as finding rarer items. See the Codex Mandatum document for more details on settlement economic activity.

## Weapons and Armor

The Warcraft universe has several special varieties for existing weapons, as described below.

Clothes can be infused as if armors (with armor-specific infusions). They do not count as armor for the purposes of class features that require you to be armored or unarmored (such as the Defense Fighting Style or Unarmored Defense feature) unless they alter your AC.

Some weapons are described as if based off another weapon (for example, the greathammer and the maul). If proficient with the original weapon (the maul), one week of training confers proficiency to the second (greathammer). Firearms require one week of training to be counted as martial weapons, and proficiency with Engineer’s Tools automatically confers proficiency.
<br><br>
<div class="classTable wide">

| Name | Cost | Damage | Mass | Properties | Proficiency |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Attack Claws | 2 gp | 1d4 slashing | 2 lb. | Finesse, light | As dagger | 
| Bayonet | | | | | As original weapon | 
| Garrote Wire | 1 sp | 1d4 slashing | - | Finesse, light, two-handed | Simple proficiency | 
| Greathammer | 10 gp | 2d6 bludgeoning | 10 lb. | Heavy, two-handed | As maul | 
| Moonglaive | 10 gp | 1d6 slashing | 3 lb. | Finesse | As shortsword | 
| Spiked Chain | 15 gp | 1d6 slashing | 10 lb. | Finesse, reach, two-handed | Martial proficiency |
| Sword, Two-Bladed | 15 gp | 1d8 slashing | 10 lb. | Finesse | As longsword | 
| Syringe | 5 gp | 1 piercing | 1/2 lb. | Light | As dagger | 
| Totem, Tauren | 10 gp | 2d6 bludgeoning | 10 lb. | Heavy, two-handed | As greatclub | 
| Warglaive | 15 gp | 1d6 slashing | 2 lb. | Finesse, light | As scimitar | 

</div>

##### Attack Claws
These claws may be attached to a hand, and allow for a user to perform somatic components without occupying the hand (as if a spellcasting focus). They are usually favored by orcish shamans who enter melee after conjuring elementals or placing totems. This is based on the dagger.

##### Bayonet
This dagger-like blade can be attached to a firearm or crossbow, allowing it to make melee weapon attacks. Longer bayonets can act as shortswords or longswords instead (attached to medium and heavy firearms respectively). This requires the proficiency of the weapon described. Some firearms are modified with different weapons. The weapon cannot be heavier than the firearm itself. Weapons attached to firearms or crossbows can be enchanted (as normal weapons).

##### Garrote Wire
This weapon can be used to start a grapple with an attack roll instead of making a Strength (Athletics) check, but suffers disadvantage to the roll if the target is aware of the attacker. This is a simple weapon.

##### Greathammer
This iconic paladin weapon is favored by the Order of the Holy Light. This is based on the maul.

##### Moonglaive
This circular blade has three dagger-like blades jutting from its sides. Uncommonly seen but easy to train with, Moonglaives are favored by the night elves of Kalimdor. This is based on the shortsword.

##### Spiked Chain
A 10-foot chain marked with a large hook, this spiked chain is a dangerous and rare weapon to see in the battlefield. A hooked spiked chain can tether on a successful hit (see Chapter 9). This is a martial weapon.

##### Sword, Two-Bladed
Typically used only by elven swordsmen of great agility, the two-bladed sword is almost iconic of the high elven military. This sword can be used to attack with both ends as if using two weapons, despite being a single melee weapon that can is used in one hand. This otherwise acts as two-weapon fighting with all other respects. The weapon is also infused as if one weapon. This is based on the longsword.

##### Syringe
This needle is a specifically-designed weapon to inject injury poisons, plagues, and offensive potions into targets who are stabbed with it. After a successful attack roll, you may use a bonus action to inject the target with the contents of the syringe. This is based on the dagger.

##### Totem, Tauren
Large, unwieldy, but very intricately-made, tauren totems are iconic of the tauren peoples. A tauren totem can be treated as a shaman’s totem for the purposes of scribing spells. This is based on the Greatclub.

##### Warglaive
This night elf weapon is a crescent-shaped blade about 4 feet long with a hilt in the center of the back edge. Demon hunters favor these weapons. This is based on the scimitar.

#### Hearthstone Set
Hearthstone is a magical card game popular in inns and taverns across Azeroth. Its mascot is Harth Stonebrew, a dwarven innkeeper who, within the game's fiction, runs a special inn that always appears to travelers in need, no matter where they are. Hearthstone cards and boards are minor magic items, woven with spells meant to automatically adjudicate the rules and free the players from having to manually keep track of the numbers. Cards are keyed to the buyer by touching them, and will attempt to fly to the buyer after being played or discarded if the buyer

\columnbreak

is nearby (as if with the mage hand cantrip), unless physically prevented from doing so.

Both the cards and the boards can be disenchanted, but will yield no components that would be of use in crafting equipment useful to adventurers. Decks have rarity as magic items, however, with Common rarity at +0 bonus, Uncommon at +1, Rare at +2, and Epic at +3.

##### Portable board
The decks replicate the prestidigitation and minor illusion cantrips, but only to serve the game’s function.

##### Full-size board
Fuller sets are physically larger, and can serve the players with more detail than the portable board, adding illusory fountains, lights, minor movement, terrain re-textures of the board, and minor self-repair as if also containing the Light, Dancing Lights, and Mending cantrips.

##### Basic Set
These are enough cards to play Hearthstone with. This set has no deck bonus, but can be of a specific build. Each set is flavored to act as a specific class. This does not pre-determine the deck structure (see below), but usually suggests one (warlocks lean to spell or minion builds, paladins lean towards hero or endurance builds, etc.)

##### Card Pack
The card pack has 5 random cards. Roll 1d10 for each pack opened. On a roll of a 10, you get cards good enough to add you a +1 bonus to your ability check to play.

Every twenty packs opened automatically give you a +1 bonus (appropriately increasing rarity as previously described).

The detect magic spell reveals auras of the illusion and transmutation schools around both the decks and the cards.

An Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the following:
* **DC 10.** The cards and the deck have complementary enchantments. Like a lock and a key, they are useless and effectively inert without each other.
* **DC 15.** The magical patterns encode the rules of the game. For example, a board will flash red instead of the usual blue and refuse to activate if an illegal deck is inserted (such as one with fewer or more than 30 cards or cards incompatible with the class theme).
* **DC 20.** The magical patterns of the board are basically series of instructions detailing what action to perform for everything the players might attempt, encoded in a whole complicated system built atop the primal language of the arcane. The pattern of each card is more like a description of its statistics and effect that can be "read" by a suitable magic device (which is the board).

#### Jihui Set
The board game known as jihui is one of the most prominent games found throughout Pandaria, mostly among the pandaren. It is gaining in popularity outside the continent, however.

\pagebreakNum

### Hearthstone Rules
A collectible card game in which players obtain cards by purchasing packs, Hearthstone uses game decks of 30 cards with each player.

During a match, each of the two players controls a character called a hero (usually appearing as they do) and can play cards drawn from their deck each turn, which are divided into minions (creatures that fight on the battlefield), spells (which affect the battlefield), weapons (which are equipped by heroes, allowing them to attack), and hero cards (which replace the hero with another one with different abilities). The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy hero by dealing enough damage to bring it down to zero health.

Periodically, expansions to the game are released, creating new opportunities for deck-building. This changes the game, making some current decks obsolete due to ‘power creep’ and requiring players to build new ones to stay competitive.

#### Prerequisites
At a minimum, each player needs a basic set (1 gp, as above). One board is also needed to play the game. Basic sets and packs can generally be bought in taverns and general stores in any moderate-to-large settlement. A portable board is compact enough to be carried around and allow the game to be played in the field; full-size, stationary boards are typically installed in taverns and gambling dens, and have greater magical effects (see Magic below).

#### Resolving a Hearthstone match
Proficiency with Hearthstone as a game set allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. For a normal game, you may use Intelligence (if playing tactically), Spirit (if anticipating and preparing for enemy counters), or Charisma (if relying on psychological tactics and reading the enemy).

The contested roll is as follows.
<br><br>
**Hearthstone Roll Modifier** = your proficiency bonus

(if proficient in the gaming set) +

your chosen mental ability score modifier +

your deck bonus (from +0 to +3)
___

The higher dice result wins. In case of a tie, both checks are rerolled (which can represent anything from a rematch to a forced change in tactics).

You have advantage on this check if you somehow learn about the contents of your opponent's deck, the order in which your cards will be drawn, or some other method of cheating.

You have disadvantage to this check if you have a build weakness (such as using an Endurance build against a Spell build).

#### Deck-Building and Deck Bonus
The deck bonus reflects the current competitive value of a deck. It ranges from 0 to +3. On average, it takes about twelve packs to collect enough card synergy to raise the deck bonus by 1. Some decks are pre-designed, having an established beck bonus, but usually can be improved by opening card packs.

#### Deck Structure
A deck can be built to serve one tactic at the expense of another. Starter decks have no special strengths or weaknesses, but you may choose one tactic over the course of collecting cards.

| Deck Structure | Strong versus |
|:---:|:---:|
| Minion | Hero | 
| Hero | Spell | 
| Spell | Endurance | 
| Endurance	| Minion | 

##### Minion Deck
This deck relies on multiple weak cards to overwhelm individual strong ones, such as by using summoning cards and cards that spawn more minions every round. This tactic is also sometimes known as ‘zerging’ in some circles. It is weak against the Endurance build, since the defensive style the build employs outlasts and exhausts Minion builds’ cards.

##### Hero Deck
This tactic relies on one powerful card (or few powerful ones) and supportive cards that increase the power of the hero (or central card) and weaken the enemy. Hero builds can destroy Spell builds before they gather power, but are vulnerable to Minion builds which can overwhelm the build’s ability to withstand multiple enemies.

##### Spell Deck
This tactic relies on using special spell cards to destroy several cards at once, but takes time to build up. Spell builds can out-damage the slower and more defensive Endurance builds, but need more time to gather power, which makes it vulnerable against the quick and decisive action of Hero builds.

##### Endurance Deck
This tactic relies on a defensive mindset to outlast and exhaust the opponent's cards while whittling down the opponent. Endurance builds can reduce Minion builds to nothing while taking very little damage in return over a longer game period, but it is vulnerable to Spell cards, which can crush Endurance builds the longer the game goes.

##### Chosing your deck
When playing against a deck to which you have a build disadvantage, you roll your d20 with disadvantage.

Every character has a build they prefer that appeals to their personality. Choose a build or roll on the table below for existing characters.

| d6 | Build Type |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1-2 | Standard (no weakness or strength) | 
| 3	| Minion build | 
| 4 | Hero build | 
| 5 | Spell build | 
| 6 | Endurance build | 

\pagebreakNum

#### Game Expansions
Expansions to Hearthstone are released thrice per year: every early spring, midsummer, and late autumn. Every expansion release lowers the deck bonus of every existing deck, everywhere in the world, by 1, to a minimum of 0.

This reflects the need to buy newly released cards to stay competitive with each expansion release.

### Jihui Rules
A strategic game played on a flat checkered black-and-white board, jihui players navigate their pieces to defeat their opponents’ pieces (as Chess, popular with Stormwind and Dalaran’s elite). Unlike with chess, however, jihui pieces also include ships.

Jihui encapsulates much of pandaren philosophy. It simultaneously encourages thoughtfulness and incorporates impulsiveness. It balances deliberation with chance, but chance can also be punished. For a player to lose to a foe who has more pieces on the board is not a great loss. To yield to a superior position, regardless of the pieces in play, is not considered an honorless loss. While the game's aim is to eliminate all the opposition's pieces, playing to that point is considered ill-mannered and even barbaric. Usually, one player finds themselves out-maneuvered and surrenders, though some rely on chance to turn their fortune around and achieve victory. Playing to a standstill, having both players' forces balanced, is considered the greatest victory of them all and shows not only skill, but restraint and discipline.

## Treasures
The Warcraft universe has many treasures, ranging from items infused with magic (such as named weapons and the Hearthstone), to armor sets that grant features when used together, to enhancements and epic boons. The creation of infused items is elaborated in Chapter 7 under Infusion Kits.

### Infused Items

<br>

#### Annihilator
**Weapon (battleaxe), rare**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Whenever this wicked-looking, dark purple battleaxe deals damage to a creature benefitting from an armor bonus to AC, it reduces their bonus to AC by 1 point. The penalty to armor remains for until the target creature completes a short rest. This reduction can stack (until the armor grants no bonus).

#### Arcanite Reaper
**Weapon (greataxe), rare**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This axe is made out of arcanite, one of the hardest substances in existence (AC 23, immune to nonmagical weapon damage, and has 30 hit points), and deals double damage to objects.

#### Black Grasp of the Destroyer
**Wondrous item, uncommon**
<br>
This heavy steel gauntlet has runes carved into the knuckles and the back of the hand. With a touch, this allows the user to cast dispel magic (at a 3rd level spell). This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Bladefist
**Weapon (attack claws), epic**
<br>
You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This weapon has 3 charges. When attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the haste spell on yourself. The weapon regains 1d3 charges every dawn.

The Bladefist is a well-known example of orcish attack claws. It is well known as the weapon of Kargath Bladefist, Chieftain of the Shattered Hand Clan and self-proclaimed Warchief of the Fel Horde. This weapon can also be used as a prosthetic.

#### Blight
**Weapon (glaive), rare**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Upon a successful attack against a creature, you may declare that the weapons’ blight ability activates as a bonus action. If blight takes place, the target must succeed against a Stamina saving throw of 15 or be subject to a random disease (as the contagion spell). This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Book of the Dead
**Wondrous item, rare (attunement optional)**
<br>
This ancient, musty tome is decorated with inlaid bones from various creatures. The cover and spine are made from dried skin stretched and treated to remain flexible.

The ink used to write the magical words and runes inside is blood drawn from the veins of living creatures killed as sacrifices when the book was completed. Activating this book requires tearing out some of its pages.

When a page is torn, it turns to dust, and animates a skeleton or zombie. These undead can be animated with a longsword and shield or with a bow and twenty arrows (undead warriors and archers, respectively). You may tear out multiple pages as an action, but only have up to ten undead creatures under your control at any given time. After 24 hours of being animated, the undead disintegrate.

So long as you possess the book, you may command the animated undead mentally with a bonus action as long as they are within 60 feet of you. The book has 100 pages, and the spells animating the undead otherwise acts as a 5th level conjure undead spell.

You may attune yourself to the book and keep as a spellbook, in which case all necromancy spells written it cost 2 less mana points when cast by you. You may still spend pages of it to conjure undead.

#### Brainsplinter
**Weapon (dagger), epic (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When striking a spellcaster, the dagger’s damage lingers and disrupts concentration (DC 10 or half damage as normal) for 1d4 rounds after being hit. If hit again, the counter resets. Activating this quality costs a bonus action, and is a strike effect.

#### Cauldron of Dimensional Parallelism
**Wondrous item, epic**
<br>
You gain +5 to alchemy crafting rolls made with this cauldron for making batches of potions.

Also, this cauldron can hold the materials to craft up to 20 potions. By turning a dial, the cauldron creates a compartment that can host different potions.

The cauldron can have a total of four chambers (5 potions each), and you can craft all such potions in parallel. If some potions are of higher rarity than others, any potions that mature during your crafting time can be removed (or replaced) without affecting your crafting process.

Also, if your crafting roll exceeds the DC by 5 or more, you get 20% extra potions.

#### Cauldron of Light
**Wondrous item, common**
<br>
You gain +1 to alchemy crafting rolls made with this cauldron for making batches of potions.

Also, while this cauldron is at full capacity (5 potions), and you succeed on crafting the potions, your potions also shed light equal to a candle. When consumed or used, they also shed light equal to the light cantrip.

#### Cauldron of the Mad Alchemist
**Wondrous item, uncommon**
<br>
You gain +3 to alchemy crafting rolls made with this cauldron for making batches of potions.

Also, while this cauldron is at full capacity (5 potions), you get 1 normal potion whenever you attempt cauldron experimentation.

If your potion would explode as a result of miscibility from cauldron experimentation, the cauldron absorbs the explosion, and temporarily becomes a normal cauldron for 1d10 days.

\pagebreakNum

Also, if your crafting roll exceeds the DC by 5 or more, you get 20% extra potions.

#### Cauldron Ladle of Wacky Experimentation
**Wondrous item, rare**
When this ladle is used during crafting experimentation, you can roll for miscibility an additional time if the previous two miscibility results are dissatisfactory. If the roll that stems from this ladle is Explosion!, the ladle temporarily becomes a normal ladle for 1d4 days and absorbs the explosion.

If the ladle is used to apply a matured potion (such as pouring it on the ladle and applying it to yourself or another) while under the effects of another potion, you can choose one of the following results:
* **Un-Wackily Be Stable.** Consume the potion and ignore miscibility
* **Wackily Experiment.** Roll twice for miscibility and choose the better result.

#### Chains of the Undying Mage
**Weapon (spiked chain), rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

* **Intuitive Use.** You gain proficiency with spiked chains.
___
Mages and wizards sworn to the Lich King that manage to achieve lichdom are wrapped with these seemingly mundane chains. However, once a lich awakens the first time after achieving lichdom, the chains hover around its arms, becoming a powerful weapon.

#### Crystal Ball
**Wondrous item, uncommon**
<br>
This sphere of green glass is inlaid with a golden base, and may be pointed at a direction to see distant events up to a mile away as clear as if one is adjacent to it. When activated, the crystal ball may scry up to any point of sight within a mile that you can see, or allows you to see an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you and is obstructed by an object (such as behind a corner, behind a door, below a trapdoor). This orb functions as long as you can expend a bonus action, up to a maximum of ten minutes. The orb creates an invisible magical sensor on the location it observes, which can be seen if observers can see invisibility or have truesight, and cannot be attacked or interacted with (though it can be dispelled as a 3rd level spell). Once used, this cannot be used again until the next dawn.

#### Dawn's Edge
**Weapon (battleaxe), rare**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The battleaxe has 3 charges. While using it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the daylight spell (centered on the battleaxe), or a bonus action to ignore the damage resistance of an undead or fiendish creature for 1 minute per charge expended. You may also cast the detect evil and good spell as a bonus action by expending 1 charge (the range increases to 60 feet).

The battleaxe regains all charges by the next dawn.

#### Demonic Figurine
**Wondrous item, legendary**
<br>
This onyx figurine is told of in legends as powerful artifacts send by the Burning Legion to pave the world for its inevitable return. Featuring a baleful demon with claws outstretched and a single hoof raised, the figurine can be pointed to a creature, unleashing a ray of doom. This is treated as the demonic doom spell, and the figurine maintains the sigil until the entire duration has ended without fail. The figurine possesses malevolent cunning, and uses the spell to wreak the most devastation it could before it is ended. Destroying a figurine unleashes the Doomguard, which is fully present (as if by an uncontrolled bind spell).

#### Doomhammer
**Weapon (warhammer), uncommon (greater attunement)**
<br>
Beyond the bonuses of the weapon upon attunement (see Greater Attunement), this weapon is treated as a thrown weapon (20/60 feet). Also, the elemental tongue spell costs instead 2 less point of manas.

If you cannot cast the spell, it can be cast two times (spell level 1) before uses are replenished at dawn.

The Doomhammer is a powerful enormous hammer that was crafted long ago in a pool of elemental lava on the orc homeworld of Draenor. It is a namesake relic passed down from father to son, and was given to Thrall as a testament of faith and honor during the salvation of the orcs. Although the hilt of the hammer has been replaced, the actual hammerhead itself, crafted of elementally-treated black granite, has endured as a testament of the crafter's skill.

#### Embrace of the Twisting Nether
**Armor (chainmail), rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this magic armor.

By speaking the command word, you become ethereal (as if subject to the banishment spell). The banishment spell remains for full duration (one minute) unless the command word is spoken to cancel it. If the command word is not spoken and the duration of one minute passes, you are banished to the Twisting Nether, the realm of demons and chaotic energy. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Fearbreaker
**Weapon (mace or tauren totem), epic (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain +2 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When attuned to and wielding this weapon, you may cast the fear ward spell, treating the mace as the totem. Once used, this cannot be used again until the next dawn.

#### Felo'melorn
**Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)**
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This sword has 3 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and cast any one of the following spells as an action.

\pagebreakNum

#### Flame Strike
**Elemental Tongue (Fire only), spell level 4**
<br>
*Special.* Felo'melorn can always be remade when destroyed, and gains an additional charge if destroyed by a foe and reforged by who was attuned to it. It can have a maximum number of charges equal to 6.

If the blade itself is used to kill who it is attuned to, it loses all extra charges and returns to its original number of charges.

Flamestrike in common, Felo’melorn is an ancient Highborne runeblade once wielded by Dath'Remar Sunstrider, even before the War of the Ancients. It is rumored to have once been his favored weapon, and over many generations was passed down through the Sunstrider dynasty. During the Third War, Anasterian Sunstrider wielded the sword in battle against Arthas Menethil, but Frostmourne severed the blade and he was defeated. Later, Kael'thas Sunstrider, last of the Sunstrider line, recovered it and had it reforged, with ‘magic, hatred and a burning need of revenge.’

#### Gorehowl
**Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You may swing the axe as an action to cast the Fear spell. Furthermore, once attuned to this axe, you may choose to gain one of the following talents:
* Brutal Critical
* Weapon Mastery
___
Gorehowl, the axe of Hellscream, has a heavy blade that is notched and stained, with sharp, wicked curves. Small holes dot the blade near the handle; when the wielder swings the axe, air whistles through these holes. The sound keens over the battlefield, magically strengthened and imbued with otherworldly power. Gorehowl is one of Azeroth's most feared and notorious weapons.
#### Great Fel Blade
**Weapon (two-bladed sword), rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You have +1 to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.

While attuned to it, you may use this blade to cleave in a quarter-circle (90-degree sphere) within your reach. Creatures in the area take damage as if hit with the sword, with an Agility check to half damage. The DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. If you have multiple attacks, you can spend up to two attacks to make the area a half-circle.

Furthermore, if you are a fiend or wield fel magic, you deal extra 7 (2d6) damage. Half this damage is fire, and the other half is fel damage.

#### Hammer of the Titans
**Weapon (greathammer), rare**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The greathammer may be swung hard at the ground as an action. All creatures within 10 feet suffer the damage of a normal attack and must pass a Strength saving throw of 15 or fall prone.

#### Hearthstone
**Wondrous item, rare**
<br>
A user may have only one hearthstone at any given time, and it is attuned as a Teleport Circle. Requiring 3 actions (object

interaction) to activate, the hearthstone teleports the user to where they last called home. When used, it takes a day to recharge. An adventurer may alter his hearthstone’s location to any indoor building he has spent more than 24 hours in, which replaces the teleport circle’s location.

This stone is given to every adventurer who leaves his city.

#### Horn of Stormwind
**Wondrous item, rare**
<br>
This lion-emblazed horn can be blown as a bonus action to cast the devotion aura spell (as a 3rd level spell, or reducing damage taken by allies by 4 points). The horn performs the required concentration. Once used two times, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

#### Jaina's Locket
**Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You may use this locket to cast the teleport spell, but only to a destination inside the borders of Dalaran. The locket treats Dalaran as a place with 'permanent circle' familiarity for the purposes of the teleport spell, and if no specific location is specified in Dalaran, it teleports the user directly to the Central Square, under the statue of Archmage Antonidas.
Other magical lockets like Jaina's Locket exist, usually providing one-way teleportation to a specific city or region.

#### Light's Vengeance
**Weapon (greathammer), uncommon (greater attunement)**
<br>
Beyond the bonuses of the weapon upon attunement (see Greater Attunement), whenever you use this weapon for a Crusader's Strike, you may choose to grant yourself resistance to any one damage type for until the end of your turn in the next round.

This greathammer with a marble-white head and mahogany shaft is infused with holy magic and consecrated to be carried by paladins of the Order of the Silver Hand. It has the potential to grow stronger with the wielder.

#### Mana Blade
**Weapon (any sword), rare**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon may cast the mana burn spell. Once used, this property cannot be used again until the next dawn.

This blade can also mana burn as a bonus action as a strike effect.

Mana blades can also take the form of a warglaive (if taking the form of a scimitar).

#### Mana Stone
**Wondrous item, rare**
<br>
This cerulean-blue semi-solid stone is nearly translucent, and shines with an internal blue light. While the mana stone is in the possession of a character with a mana pool, their passive regeneration increases by 50% (round down).

A character who benefitted from the stone for at least four hours can crush it, and absorbing the latent energies. This restores mana as if the user rested for four hours.

These stones are said to be shards of enchanted runestones that are dipped in mana fountains, but such rumors are unsubstantiated, as the secret of creation is in the elusive hands of the most talented infusionists. This item is not treated as a consumable for the purposes of crafting.

Like mana potions, consuming the mana stone does not count against the normal limit of mana restorative abilities of once per hour.

\pagebreakNum

#### Mystic Wand
**Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a spellcaster)**
<br>
A wand of minor power allows you to gain the benefits of the Mystic Blast feat without gaining the feat itself. Each wand is attuned to a specific energy type. This also does not require mana in reserve, and can provide one augmentation when having the feat.

The common version of the wand deals one dice of damage (1d6 fire, cold, lightning, or acid, or 1d4 holy, unholy, fel, or arcane). For each step of rarity, it deals an additional dice (up to 5 dice at Legendary, as below). Treat the relevant spell level as described in the chart.

| Rarity | Dice| Spell Level |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Common | 1 dice | 1 | 
| Uncommon | 3 dice | 3 | 
| Rare | 5 dice | 5 | 
| Epic | 7 dice | 7 | 
| Legendary	| 9 dice | 9 | 

#### Orkenblade
**Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

#### Phantom Blade
**Weapon (longsword), rare**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Upon a successful attack against a creature, you may declare that the weapons’ phantom touch ability activates as a bonus action. If phantom touch takes place, the targeted creature is subject to a faerie fire spell (centered on the creature only) for one minute. If affected once, the creature is immune against further uses for 24 hours.

#### Philosopher's Stone
**Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
While attuned to this stone, two different ability scores of your choice increases by 1 (maximum 18). If you are an Alchemist with the Inurement ability, all your potions cost 2 less Crafting Points.

A philosopher's stone is required for the transmute material spell. Creating this stone requires proficiency in Alchemist’s Supplies.

#### Prismatic Blade
**Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls while using this magic weapon. While wielding this longsword, you can add your Agility modifier to attack and damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.

If you are wielding this sword and not benefiting from a shield, add a +2 bonus to your AC.

This magic weapon has 4 charges, regaining 1d4 charges daily at dawn. It may have one of the following abilities.
* **Augment.** With an action, you may cast the enhance ability spell. This can affect anything touching the blade (including yourself or any ally you touch). This costs 1 charge.
* **Guard.** With an action, you can cast the power word: shield spell. This can affect anything touching the blade (including yourself or an ally you touch). This costs 1 charge.
* **Weave.** With an action, you may cast the prismatic spray spell. This costs 4 charges.
* **Unweave.** You may cast the dispel magic spell as part of drawing the blade (free action), or with an action if it is already drawn. This spell is limited to touch range, however, and can affect anything touching the blade (including yourself, an ally you touch, or any spell targeting you). This costs 2 charges. The spell’s level is equal to 4 if the rarity is Rare, 6 if Epic, and 8 if Legendary.
___
There are many Prismatic Blades. Three of the best known are Quel'Serrar, Quel’Zaram, and Quel'delar. All such blades are ancient, forged by dragons long ago and gifted to the kaldorei to aid them in the War of the Ancients.

Currently, most remain dull and forgotten, though it can be re-forged by heating in dragon-fire, and being quenched in dragon blood (which gives it the reputation of being a dragon-slaying blade).

A dulled Prismatic Blade has 0 charges, but otherwise acts otherwise same way.

The greater the rarity of the prismatic blade, the more abilities it may have.

Epic blades (such as Quel’Zaram) has three abilities, and has a +2 bonus to attack and damage.

##### Secrets of the Prismatic Blades
**Awakening and Reforging**
<br>
"What I offer to you now is one such blade, unfired, unheated, untreated - the most raw and basic form. Now you merely need to find a dragon that will willing enchant the blade…"

A dulled Prismatic Blade must be re-ignited to act in its full capacity.

When subject to a true dragon's breath weapon by itself (such as by being in the area of the breath weapon and not being wielded, tricking a dragon to breathe upon it, or leaving it in the mouth of a dying dragon), there is a chance the blade is re-enchanted. This depends on the age of the dragon. On a failed enchantment, the dragon cannot try again until it advances to the next age category.

| Age | Chance of Enchantment |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| Wyrmling | 1% | 
| Young | 25% | 
| Adult | 50% | 
| Ancient | 100% | 
___
**Merging**
<br>
Prismatic blades can be merged together in very rare instances, such as the blades Shalla'tor and Ellemayne merging into Shalamayne.

If a character manages to merge two prismatic blades, the blade turns into a greatsword (such as Quel’Zaram), and occupies only one attunement slot. The rarity of the merged blade is one step higher than the average of the two, and gains a +1 additional bonus to attack and damage.

Shalla’tor and Ellemayne are act as normal Prismatic Blades, but are Epic in quality and have a +2 bonus to attack and damage. They have the Augment, Guard, and Unweave abilities.

\pagebreakNum

By merging together, Shalamayne becomes legendary rarity, has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and its Unweave ability functions as spell level 8.

#### Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron
**Wondrous item, epic (requires attunement)**
<br>
This cube of metallic-like material is actually a puzzle box. Its sides can be manipulated by pushing and twisting, though it is unknown of anyone managed to solve it.
The user may attempt a DC 25 Intelligence check to begin cracking the puzzle box. Upon each success, the bearer of the box gains an additional ability as they make significant advancement to opening the puzzle-box. The user should record successes and failures simultaneously.

##### Successes Ability

| | |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1 | Can cast confusion 1/day | 
| 2 | Advantage to saving throws versus mind-affecting effects | 
| 3 | Gain +1 to your Intelligence score | 
| 4	| Can cast mind blank 1/long rest | 
| 5 | Gain +1 to your Intelligence score | 
| 6	| Gain immunity to Confusion effects, and has a permanent tongues effect | 
___
##### Failures Ability
You gain a madness level, with a Spirit DC of 25 to negate.

Also, instead of having to choose a coping mechanism and being bound to it, you can instead take a -1 penalty to your Spirit score and gain a +2 bonus to future rolls to use the puzzle box. This stacks to a maximum of -5 penalty to your Spirit score and +10 to your Intelligence rolls at level 5 of madness.

If you gained more than three levels of madness from the puzzle box, you also have disadvantage to all saving throws versus illusions and effects that deal psychic damage.

Whenever attempting to solve the puzzle-box, the user hears one of the below quotes in their mind (as telepathy, choose randomly).

| | |
|:---:|:-----------:| 
| 1 | At the bottom of the ocean even light must die. | 
| 2 | The silent, sleeping, staring houses in the backwoods always dream. It would be merciful to tear them down. | 
| 3 | There is no sharp distinction between the real and the unreal. | 
| 4	| Even death may die. | 
| 5 | There is a little lamb lost in dark woods. | 
| 6 | All places, all things have souls. All souls can be devoured. | 
| 7 | What can change the nature of a man? | | 8	| Do you dream while you sleep or is it an escape from the horrors of reality? | 
| 9 | Look around. They will all betray you. Flee screaming into the black forest. | 
| 10 | In the land of Ny'alotha there is only sleep. | 
| 11 | Y'knath k'th'rygg k'yi mrr'ungha gr'mula. | 
| 12 | The void sucks at your soul. It is content to feast slowly. | 
| 13 | The drowned god's heart is black ice. | 

| | |
|:---:|:-----------:| 
| 14 | It is standing right behind you. Do not move. Do not breathe. | 
| 15 | Have you had the dream again? A black goat with seven eyes that watches from the outside. In the sunken city, he lays dreaming. | 
| 16 | Open me! Open me! Open me! Then only will you know peace. | 
| 17 | You resist. You cling to your life as if it actually matters. You will learn. | 
| 18 | The tortured spirits of your ancestors cling to you, screaming in silence. Apparently they are quite numerous. | 
| 19 | Beneath the shadow of the darkened spire, there is no light, no mercy, only void, and the chaos within. | 
| 20 | You will all be alone in the end. | 

#### Quilen Statuette
**Wondrous item, rare**
<br>
You can use an action to hold the statuette aloft and speak the command word. Doing so conjures a Quilen, as if you had cast the conjure construct spell (spell level 5). The statuette can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

This statuette, carved during the brief reign of Mogu emperor Kang of Pandaria, was part of an experiment to bind Quilen servants in small stones. This experiment was abandoned as the Quilen thus bound were greatly diminished in power and thus deemed unworthy.

**Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)**

You gain +3 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Once attuned to this greatsword, you may gain the Inspiring Leader feat (regardless of your actual Charisma score). A creature can benefit from the temporary hit points granted by this feat twice before a short rest.

This blade had only one bearer—the general of Stormwind, who was the Lion of Azeroth, Sir Anduin Lothar. The blade was broken during his climactic battle against Orgrim Doomahammer, and the pieces of the blade were then carried by his second-in-command, the paladin Turalyon, who still retains the pieces.

#### Runespear
Weapon (halberd), epic (requires attunement)
You gain +2 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While attuned to this weapon, you may increase your Stamina score by 2 (maximum 22).

This halberd was wielded by the chief of Bloodhoof Tauren, and remains as a symbol of their tenacity and will.

#### Sageblade
**Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While wielding this sword, you may use your Intelligence or Charisma for attack and damage rolls with the sageblade instead of Strength or Agility. You may also gain the benefit of the Spell Strike feat for up to three times. Once used three times, the spell strike property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

#### Saronite Mindcrusher
**Weapon (mace), rare**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

As a bonus action, you can declare a mind-crushing strike. On a successful hit, you deal 1 point of mana burn for every 4 points of damage you deal. For every 4 points of mana burn you deal, the target takes 1 point of arcane damage.

This otherwise acts as the mana burn spell. This is a strike effect.

This otherwise acts as the mana burn spell.

After you make this strike up to three times, you cannot use it again until the next sundown.

#### Scimitar of the Sirocco
**Weapon (scimitar), epic (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

It also has the following additional properties. When one of these properties is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
* **Flame.** While wielding this weapon, you may brandish it at any area within 100 feet, causing a column of fire to rise up, as per the flame strike spell.
* **Scorch Strike.** When you hit with a melee attack using the scimitar, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 fire damage. This is a strike effect that costs a bonus action.
* **Searing Blitz.** Before you attack with the scimitar, you may declare a searing blitz. Until you end your turn, you gain +2 to AC versus attacks of opportunity, and leave a trail of lingering flame behind you whenever you move. This trail can have a maximum length of half your speed, acts as normal fire, and deals 1d6 fire damage to creatures moving through it. It remains for one minute, and is 5-feet wide and rises 5-feet high.

#### Spell Shield Amulet
**Wondrous item, uncommon**
<br>
You can cast the counterspell spell, but the spell you choose must include you as a target. Once used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

#### Spiritual Essence
**Wondrous item, rarity varies**
<br>
A translucent substance that is yielding to the touch, spiritual essence stores the soul-power of a creature. The essence is so pure, that any other soul can absorb it.

Spiritual essence can be consumed to add experience points equal to 1/2 the target's total experience points value (if possessing class levels), or their XP appropriate to their challenge (if a monster).

*Note.* Spiritual essence is not naturally-occuring, but can be created by casting an essence seal spell that is equal in spell level to half the target's HD or Challenge, succeeding in capturing the essence (as per the spell) and then casting the wish spell, or using divine intervention or similar abilities to draw out spiritual essence. A creature turned into Spirit Essence does not give experience to whoever defeated it.  A creature whose essence is consumed must be released by the wish spell or divine intervention. If consumed, a creature cannot be resurrected, as their soul is obliterated and consumed.

A single given creature can only benefit once from consuming spiritual essence, as consuming it also bestows a shard of the consumed creature's mind to the one who consumed it, usually warping their thoughts and inflicting a minor type of insanity, or causing them to hear hallucinations (usually as if the consumed creature is speaking to them). A creature whose essence is consumed cannot be resurrected, as their soul is obliterated and consumed.

\pagebreakNum

Demons of great power usually make spiritual essence of particularly tenacious victims to torment them, as the creature is always aware of what is around it, but cannot communicate (is treated as if beyond death, so Speak with Dead cannot function either). This represents artifacts such as the Skull of Gul’dan.

For this purpose, if Gul'dan is a 20th level warlock, then his Spirit Essence will yield 177,500 XP (1/2 of 355,000).

#### Staff of Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan
**Weapon (staff), epic (requires attunement by a druid, mage, shaman, or warlock)**
<br>
You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this magic staff. If you already have resistance, you are immune to fire damage.

The staff has 10 Charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its Charges to cast one of the following Spells from it, using your spell save DC: burning hands (1 charge), fireball (3 charges), or wall of fire (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.

Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan was the leader of the Dark Iron dwarves during the War of the Three Hammers. When he lost Ironforge to the Bronzebeard clan, Thaurissan retreated to the Redridge Mountains and founded a city in his name. In a desperate attempt to defeat his enemies, Thaurissan accidentally summoned the demigod Ragnaros, which resulted in the sorcerer-thane's immediate death and the formation of the volcanic peak of Blackrock Mountain.

#### Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros
**Weapon (maul), legendary (requires attunement)**

#### Sunstrider Longbow
**Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain +3 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

* Tranquilizing shot (1 charge)
* Viper shot (1 charge)
___
The longbow regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

Dath'Remar Sunstrider, the ancestor of Kael'thas Sunstrider, owned this bow in ages past. It was passed down through the generations until finally given to Sylvanas Windrunner, Ranger-General of Quel'Thalas, with whom it still remains.

#### The Planar Edge
**Weapon (battleaxe), epic (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

#### Tiriosh, Nightmare of Ages
**Weapon (dagger), epic (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain +2 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

With a bonus action, the dagger can split into two identical ones with the same statistics, so long as they are held by you.
Once attuned to this dagger, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Agility modifier. You also reduce any fall damage you take by 25 points of damage (minimum 0).

This dagger looks like a monstrous fang. When twisted in a specific way, it breaks into two identical thinner blades. If one dagger is more than 30 feet away from another, the one furthest to you disappears, and re-appears bonded to the first dagger.

#### Trol'kalar
**Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain +1 attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Once attuned to this longsword, it may be used to apply the Mortal Strike warrior ability. If you already have this ability, the longsword deals one additional dice of damage against any creature that has regeneration or the rapid regeneration feature (such as trolls).

The dread sword known as the Trol'kalar (troll slayer, in the ancient tongue), was first known to be wielded by Strom's most capable warlord, Lord Ignaeus Trollbane, during the Troll Wars.

After the war and with the departure of Thoradin's ruling descendants the Trollbane family ascended to the throne. The Trol'kalar image changed by also becoming a true emblem of power in that region, being rightly wielded only by the direct descendants of Lord Ignaeus as a symbol of rulership over the glorious Kingdom of Stromgarde.

#### Truesilver Champion
**Weapon (greatsword), rare (requires attunement)**
<br>
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. While holding this weapon, you may utter the inscription upon the blade, granting you 15 temporary hit points. Once this feature is used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

\pagebreakNum

#### Twin Blades of Azzinoth
**Weapon (warglaive), rarity varies (greater attunement)**
<br>
Beyond the bonuses of the weapon upon attunement (see Greater Attunement), whenever you cast the mage armor spell, you gain 1 additional point of AC.

Furthermore, upon a successful attack against a creature, you may declare that the weapons’ mana burn ability activates as a bonus action as a strike effect. Once used, this property cannot be used again until the next dawn. The spell level of the mana burn spell depends on the current rarity of the weapon.

| Rarity | Spell Level (Mana Burned) |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| Uncommon | 2 (1d4 + 1) | 
| Rare | 6 (2d4 + 1) | 
| Epic | 8 (3d4 + 1) | 
| Legendary | 11 (4d4 + 1) | 
___
The most well-known twin-blade is that that once belonged to the doom guard Azzinoth, whose blades were claimed by Illidan Stormrage. Twin-blades are warglaives employed by demonic felguards, and are specifically created to increase in power with the demon. As demon hunters often count as demons, twin-blades can increase in power in the hands of demon hunters as well.

#### Val’Anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings
**Weapon (mace), epic**
<br>
You gain +2 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You may the power word: shield spell as a bonus action, but only at a range of touch, or to a target of a healing spell you cast. Once this feature is used three times, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

#### Verdant Sphere
**Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)**
<br>
Verdant spheres are mana stones attuned to ley lines to the point of drawing power from them. Many types of verdant spheres exist, each with different powers drawn upon the ley line's attunements. Legend has it the orb siphons a portion of the essence of every evil outsider slain by its owner. The orb draws on the essence of these demons for its own powers, the spirits writhing in torment within it for all eternity. The truth of the matter, however, is that there are simply powerful arcane tools, sometimes known as mooncrystals in Quel’Thalas. The Blood Mage Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider is known to have the largest collection on Verdant Spheres, possessing the Attunement, Fire, and Demonic Drain spheres.

When inactive, they appear to be fist-sized orbs of opaque glass. When activated by a caster's command, they burst into flame of a color attuned to the user and hover above their heads. Some casters prefer to disguise them behind an illusion, however, or keep them inactive until needed. When you use an action to toss one of these spheres into the air, the sphere orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Agility (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

\columnbreak

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head and shoulders, and is thus only subject to being damaged when it is specifically targeted.

##### Absorption (Epic)
You can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and loses its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

##### Agility (Epic)
Your Agility score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

##### Attunement (Epic)
You can attune yourself to two other infused items. This sphere itself does not require attunement.

##### Awareness (Rare)
You can't be surprised.

##### Demonic Drain (Rare)
Draining mana from demons grants double the normal mana amount possible.

##### Fortitude (Epic)
Your Stamina score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

##### Fire (Epic)
The area of your fire spells is doubled.

##### Frost (Epic)
The area of your cold spells is doubled.

##### Greater Absorption (Legendary)
You can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and loses its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

##### Insight (Epic)
Your Spirit score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

##### Intellect (Epic)
Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

##### Leadership (Epic)

##### Regeneration (Legendary)
You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.

\pagebreakNum

##### Reserve (Rare)
This sphere spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. It can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the sphere by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the sphere. If the sphere can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the spell determines how much space it uses.

This uses the spell’s level, save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the sphere is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

##### Strength (Epic)
Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

##### Sustenance (Rare)
You don't need to eat or drink.

#### Voodoo Doll
**Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by any spellcaster who can cast Speak with Dead)**
<br>
A voodoo doll seems innocent, but it is actually a house of a Hexer spirit. Hexer spirits bound to a voodoo doll are servitors to whoever is attuned to the doll, serving them in return for favors.

A voodoo doll may be attuned with a target with one hour of contact with a remaining body part or piece (such as a finger, hair, or fingernail). So long as the target does not take the measures to end the bond (such as by replacing the finger or removing a hand, cutting all their hair, or clipping all their fingernails, as determined by the DM), the Hexer spirit is always aware of where the target is, as if under the effects of a locate creature spell.

The Hexer spirit can be allowed to leave the voodoo doll to use its Carry Voodoo power, which allows the owner of the doll to cast a spell for the Hexer to carry, or harm the doll and order the hexer spirit to use its Withering Touch ability on the target (usually until they die, or the victim is at the point where the witch doctor wants them).

The DM has the Hexer Spirit’s statistics (Monster Guide).

#### Warden’s Cloak
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Specially constructed for the night elves' wardens, these green velvet cloaks bear a fringe of deadly, razor-sharp blades along the hem, resembling the wings of an owl. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:
* You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* You ignore damage by falling, as if under the effects of the feather fall spell.
* You may conjure two daggers from the cloak’s folds. This does not cost an action, but the daggers remain until the end of your turn, afterwards they disappear.
___
Wardens who don this cloak are usually talented with knife-throwing (taking the fan of knives talent).

#### Wisp Amulet
**Wondrous item, rare**
<br>
The wearer of this amulet may transform into a wisp for up to 1 minute. This is a polymorph effect. This property of the amulet can’t be used again until the next sundown. The DM has the wisp’s statistics.

### Artifacts
#### Anathema and Benediction
**Weapon (staff), artifact (requires attunement)**
<br>
This staff can be wielded as a magical quarterstaff that grants a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 50 charges. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the ancient wood that keeps the Anathema and Benediction heads away from one another crumble, and the two gravitate towards one another, before clashing, and disappearing. On a 20, the staff regains 1d6 charges. After one year of disappearing, the staff re-forms elsewhere in Azeroth with full charges.

##### Strike of the Cursed and Blessed
When you hit with a melee attack using the staff and use 1 charge, you can expend 1 charge to cause one of the two opposing heads to strike. If choosing Anathema, the staff deals an extra 2d8 shadow damage to any target it hits. If choosing Benediction, the staff instead deals 2d8 holy damage to any target it hits. This is a strike effect and requires a bonus action to activate as normal.

##### Channel Divinity
You can use 3 charges to regain a use of your channel divinity ability (if you have it). This can be used once until the next dawn.

##### Spells
While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC:

* holy nova (heightened to 4th level; 4 charges)

* conjure undead (heightened to 4th level; 4 charges)
* dispel magic (3 charges)
* protection from evil and good (1 charge)
* hallow/unhallow.

#### Ashbringer
**Weapon (greatsword), artifact (requires attunement)**
<br>
This sword can be wielded as a magic greatsword that grants a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it. Any undead destroyed by this sword is burnt to ash, utterly destroying the corpse. The weapon’s additional damage is treated as fire or holy damage (whichever is most beneficial).

##### Ashen Strike
If this blade slays an undead spellcaster who has bonded (or animated) undead, the spells are instantaneously dispelled, dispelling the bonds (setting them loose) or dispelling the animation spell (if the creature is not bound). If this blade slays any creature, the corpse (if any) cannot be used to animate undead.

##### Light-Blessed Sight
While attuned to this blade, you have the benefits of true seeing against undead, but only to the range of 30 feet.
___
Forged by King Magni Bronzebeard in grief over his brother’s death in during the Second War out of a Light-infused crystal, Ashbringer has a storied history. Its last wielder was the paladin Highlord Mograine.

Although it succeeded in containing the Scourge's efforts to spread south throughout the Eastern Kingdoms, its true strength can possibly rival that of Frostmourne.

#### Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian
**Weapon (staff), artifact (requires attunement)**
<br>
This staff can be wielded as a magical quarterstaff that grants a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it. If attuned to Atiesh, you may use an action to summon it to your possession, regardless of where it currently is (this acts as a plane shift spell).

The staff has 50 charges. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff temporarily loses its powers for until the next dawn and becomes a +1 magical quarterstaff.

##### Guardian Magic
While attuned to the artifact, any spell you cast is treated as heightened by one level for no cost (up to 9th level), and you gain advantage to all dealings with outsiders, fey, undead, and elementals.

##### Spells
While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: fear (3 charges), gate (9 charges; opens to anywhere, or Karazhan if unspecified), glyph of warding (can heighten to any level; 1 charge per level), phantom steed (3 charges), plane shift (7 charges), polymorph (4 charges), private sanctum (heightened to 6th level; 6 charges)

##### Watchers
While attuned to this artifact, ravens are drawn to you and often remain close, observing and warning you of any dangers they can notice.

##### Destroying the Staff
The only way to destroy the staff is either to have it cloven in two by a Titan’s weapon, affected by the elemental attacks of the four Elemental Lords of Azeroth for one entire day, being consumed by an Old God for one hour, or being targeted with an archdemon’s wish spell. The destruction of the staff breaks it into forty-two pieces (the head, tail, and forty shards), and curses it to be bound with a powerful demon (Atiesh, the Hand of Sargeras; an Eredar Warlock). If the staff’s pieces are ever brought together again, the demon arises to kill the collector and retrieve the staff to his demon master.
___
Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian is a powerful staff passed down through the line of the Guardians of Tirisfal up until and including Medivh, the last Guardian. It is currently wielded by Medivh's former apprentice, Khadgar. The staff was born from the "seed of hate" and grants its wielder "power unending". It was passed down by each Guardian of Tirisfal to its successor. This ancient wooden staff has a red sash tied to the head, on which a raven was sculpted.

\pagebreakNum

#### Frostmourne
**Weapon (greatsword), artifact (requires attunement)**
<br>
This greatsword can be wielded as a magical greatsword that grants a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.

If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard or 1 hour after awakening from a rest of any kind (if attuned), its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the Lich King (either via the spirit of Ner’Zhul or by the blade’s own consciousness which serves it), as if by the dominate spell. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met, and the spell’s demand is usually either to spill innocent blood or move the wielder a step closer to being aligned with the Lich King’s will.

Soul Stealer. The sword traps the souls of the dead. You gain the Blood Death Knight’s Blood Strike ability. If this strike reduces the target to 0 hit points, it also steals the soul of the target, and retains it in the blade (as the essence seal spell heightened to level 10, or CR 20). The sword can contain up to 200 total CR in the blade. You have advantage to any roll to keep the souls imprisoned in the sword.

While attuned to the artifact, any necromancy or abjuration spell you cast is treated as heightened by one level (up to 9th level), and you gain advantage to all Charisma rolls to deal with undead.

##### Spells
While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (saving throw 18) from it: dominate undead (level 5), death coil (level 5), or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next midnight. You can also cast speak with dead at will on any corpse or use the spell to speak to any soul trapped in the blade.

##### Telepathic Speech
While the sword is on your person, you have a telepathic bond with the Lich King, and he is able to target you for any enchantment or necromancy spells (such as dominate person, possession, or conjure undead). If you are the Lich King, your telepathic bond extends to anyone who willingly serves you (including enslaved and animated undead).

##### Sentience
Frostmourne is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Spirit of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

##### Personality
The sword's purpose is to serve the Lich King wholly and fully. Killing the enemies of the scourge (members of the Alliance or Horde, followers of the Holy Light, and the Burning Legion if the Lich King wills it), serving the Cult of the Damned, and slaying servants of good all help fulfill this goal.
##### Destroying the Sword
The sword is destroyed should the Lich King himself be destroyed by fel or holy magic, and if it is targeted with a wish spell and a Charisma check contested with the Charisma of the sword.

The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.
___
Frostmourne is a powerful blade crafted by demons on the orders of Archimonde, bound with Ner’Zhul’s spirit into a shard of ice, and then hurled as a comet onto the highest peak of Icecrown, Azeroth’s Roof of the World. Its greatest (and only) wielder was Prince Arthas, now known as the Lich King after his mental union with Ner’Zhul. Frostmourne, as much as the Lich King, is the ruler of Northrend.

This blue-gray runeblade has a steel skull fixed into the guard, and a tough leather grip, and the runes across the width of the sword give hints of the thousands of tortured souls imprisoned in the wicked soul-stealing blade. The relic of the master of the dead, it holds great power over them.
#### Frostmourne Reforged: Shadowmourne
**Daughter Blade of Frostmourne**
<br>
The shards of a destroyed Frostmourne can be used to forge Shadowmourne.

Shadowmourne can take the form of a greatsword, longsword, greathammer, or greataxe. Its rarity decreases to Legendary (and thus can be destroyed without special conditions), its personality changes to follow the crafter’s, and loses the following features: Telepathic Speech and Soul Stealer, but retains all other features (bonus to attack and damage, spells, sentience, and magical weapon status).

#### Thoridal, the Stars’ Fury
**Weapon (longbow), artifact (requires attunement)**
<br>
This bow can be wielded as a magic longbow that grants a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it.

Thoridal can generate its own spectral arrows when used to attack, or can use normal arrows.

##### Arcane Arrows
When you expend an arrow to attack with Thoridal, it deals an additional 1d8 arcane damage on a hit, even when the arrow has its own special effect (such as an Arrow of Slaying).

##### Spectral Arrows
If you do not use a projectile, the bow creates its own spectral ammunition. The attack deals extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier on a hit, and half the damage dealt is arcane damage. Spectral arrows are white and translucent, and whoever sees it in flight at first believes it is a shooting star.

##### Arrowsmith
Whoever is attuned to Thoridal can craft magical arrows as if they were infusionists (using their own proficiency bonus for Infusion), though the arrows are designed to be used exclusively by the bow.
___
The legendary bow resonates with the power of the Sunwell. The origins and history of the weapon remain a mystery.

#### Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
**Weapon (longsword), artifact (requires attunement)**
<br>
You have +3 to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.

\pagebreakNum

While attuned to this sword, you can cast the absorb elements spell at will, but only against lightning and thunder damage as a 7th level spell. The sword has 8 charges. You can spend charges to manifest one of the following effects:
* **Discharge (2 charges).** You cast the lightning bolt spell, heightened to 7th level.
* **Lightning Rod (1 charge).** You can choose a point within 10 feet of you. Any effect that deals lightning damage and includes the point you chosen allows you to absorb elements and reduce the damage dealt by the effect by the amount you absorbed, even to other targets.
___
The sword replenishes 1d4+2 charges every dawn.
___
Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker is the legendary sword once wielded by Thunderaan, Prince of Air. The prince, son of Al'Akir the Windlord, was attacked by Ragnaros the Firelord, in an attempt to heighten the already impressive power that the fire elemental held.

Ragnaros succeeded; however, Thunderaan's power could not be completely taken into his form. What remained of Thunderaan was placed in a talisman of elemental binding, which was broken into two pieces. The pieces were then given to the Firelord's two lieutenants, Baron Geddon and Garr, respectively the left and right halves. These two halves are known as the Bindings of the Windseeker.

### Armor Sets
Armor sets are found as treasure, although they can be crafted. In case of crafting, the character must be able to craft a full set (at the highest rarity) to make an armor set.

For example, a druid who wishes to craft the Cenarion Raiment must possess the materials and ability to craft Epic armor (the rarity of the entire set).

A single armor set counts as one item for the purposes of attunement.

#### Avatar Raiment Armor
**Armor (cloth), variant (requires attunement), pieces (Vestment and cowl, gloves, mantle, arm wraps)**
<br>
* *Uncommon.* If possessing one set piece, you may add your spellcasting ability modifier again to any amount of hit points restored by flash of light or flash of shadow spells. This also applies to the amount of damage the spell would deal if targeting an undead or fiend.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, you may use a bonus action to Dash, but only to approach a wounded or unconscious ally.
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, whenever you heal or damage a target with a healing spell who has less than quarter their maximum hit points, your healing spells heal or deal 25% extra in hit points. This applies once per spell. This can stack with similar abilities.
___
This white and gold armor set is suffused with great divine power, abjuring the wearer’s face from view into a benevolent (or malevolent) shadow.

#### Blackened Defias Armor
**Armor (leather), variant (requires attunement), pieces (Armor, gloves, boot, belt)**
* *Uncommon.* If possessing one set piece, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Spirit (Perception) checks relying on sight.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, climbing doesn’t halve your speed, and you can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, you may cast the fade spell at will, or the invisibility spell three times before the spell-weaving power of the armor is expended, replenishing after the next sundown.
___
Commonly worn by commanders of the Defias Brotherhood, this suit of dark armor is ideal camouflage for skulking rogues. The Defias set is a suit of black leather armor that completely covers the wearer’s body, save for her fingers and face – the latter is usually hidden behind one of the brotherhood’s trademark red scarves.

#### Cenarion Raiment
**Armor (studded leather), variant (requires attunement), pieces (Vestments, helm, bracers, belt)**
* *Uncommon.* If possessing one set piece, other creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being hidden from you.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, you may use the druid’s wild shape ability as a 2nd level druid. If you already have the wild shape ability, you may use wild shape one more time per rest while wearing the armor, or gain one Blessed Beast feral wild shape option to benefit from one wild shape attempt (chosen once attuned to the armor).
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, the horns of the raiment remain in wild shape, granting you a natural attack that deals 2d6 damage at medium size. Before going into a wild shape, you can designate three spells to be cast upon your horns, which can then either be discharged as per the Spell Strike feat on the target of your natural attack or be cast by touching the target with your horns.
___
Created in Moonglade by the druids of the Cenarion Circle, the Cenarion raiment is worn by some of its most powerful champions as they strive to protect and preserve nature against the unnatural forces that threaten it. The Cenarion raiment features a thick brown leather robe covered in leaves and other symbols of nature – most prominently the sticks and leaves protruding from the wearer’s shoulders and the antlers resting upon his head.

#### Destroyer Armor
**Armor (plate), variant (requires attunement), pieces (breastplate, great helm, girdle, gauntlets)**
* *Uncommon.* If possessing one set piece, whenever you deal or suffer a critical hit, you are hasted (as the spell of the same name) for until the end of your turn in the next round.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, whenever you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, whenever you suffer a critical hit, it turns into a normal hit. You still gain the haste effect (as the bonus at Uncommon quality). You also gain the Aggressive talent if you don't already have it. If you do, you can gain one talent of your choice so long you wear the armor.
___
Worn by great mercenary captains, this plate of gold, rust-red, and pale blue armor casts an ominous shadow.

#### Dragonstalker Armor
**Armor (studded leather), variant (requires attunement), pieces (beastplate, helm, legguards, bracers)**
* *Uncommon.* If you score a critical hit on a ranged attack, you are hasted (as the spell) for until the beginning of your turn in the next round. If you have a bonded companion, it is similarly hasted.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, you gain an accuracy die when you successfully score a hit with a hunter [strike] spell (even if only using infused ammunition). An accuracy dice can be spent to increase your attack roll result by 1d4, reduce the mana cost of a hunter [strike] by the same amount, or be added to a roll to use a firearm or crossbow to avoid a malfunction. You cannot have more than 3 accuracy dice at a given time. Unused accuracy dice are lost after 1 hour.

\pagebreakNum

* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, you can’t be surprised while you are conscious, and you gain the favored enemy (dragons) talent. If you already have that talent, you instead gain a +5 bonus to your initiative.
___
Woven from the scales and leather of wyrms and dragons, this armor set is usually golden or red, but can be any color (depending on the dragonflight origin). Most sets were made during the Second War, and from the Red Dragonflight.
___
*Special.* Other armor sets exist in the world of Azeroth, keyed to other creature types. Such sets act similarly, but change the target of the favored enemy talent to another creature type. Such as rarer than normal sets, however.

#### Magister Regalia
**Armor (cloth), variant (requires attunement), pieces (Robe, crown, mantle, bindings)**
* *Uncommon.* If possessing one set piece, your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Agility modifier. Although altering your AC, using the set does not count as if you are armored.
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
  These enchanted vestments were originally fashioned by the master craftsmen of the Kirin Tor, the reigning magical council of Dalaran before the Third War. Only Dalaran's most elite archmagi are deemed worthy to don this astonishing attire.
___
The Regalia itself is crafted of fine crimson silk, purple velvet, and gold cord. Its belt has emeralds within, and the robes are set with a single emerald above the heart. Within the flared sleeves lies space for small pouches of spell components. To retrieve and manipulate these spell components, the gloves are open-fingered.

#### Judgment Armor
**Armor (plate), variant (requires attunement), pieces (Plate, crown, bindings, belt)**
* *Uncommon.* If possessing one set piece, you have a +5 bonus to your passive Spirit (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, you may cast the bless or aid spells up to three times (total of both spells) before the power of the armor is expended, replenishing on the next dawn. If you already have the spell readied, you may instead cast the spell for half normal cost so long as you wear the armor.
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, you may cast the arcane armor spell up to three times before the power of the armor is expended, replenishing after the next sundown. The spell is heightened to 6th level and remains for one hour. You also have the constant benefits of the bless and aid (3rd-level; or +10 to your maximum hit points) spells active. The benefit of the aid spell replenishes itself upon a short rest.
___
Though the Silver Hand is a noble establishment, there comes a time when pleasantries must end and justice must be done. The commanding, faceless aspect of justice and judgement is represented by this armor, which is worn by paladins acting as inquisitors and executioners as they deliver sentence upon the enemy.

Clad in black, red, and gold, paladins in this full-body armor cut an imposing figure. The armor is a combination of both cloth and leather for easier movement as well as metal plates to protect vital areas. Each piece is ornately detailed with icons and imagery that represent justice.

#### Plagueheart Raiment
**Armor (cloth), variant (requires attunement), pieces (Robe, circlet and mask, gloves, sandals)**
* *Uncommon.* If possessing one set piece, your spells that requires you to make an attack roll (including sigil spells) have their ranges doubled.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, and can add the necrotic aura spell to your spell list, so long as you wear the armor.
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, you have the constant effects of darkvision and demon skin (3rd-level; or 9 temporary hit points) spells. You also no longer need to breathe. The temporary hit points from demon skin replenish upon a short rest.
___
Originally designed by Burning Legion mad scientists, this colorful set is known to be worn by agents of the Legion who deal with biological and chemical warfare, as well as living members of the Cult of the Damned that need protection from the Scourge’s plague. While designed as protective gear, as a result of its origins, the gear collects and stores plagues within itself, offering these plagues as an added level of defense.

This unusual, chaotic-looking armor features patterns of black, orange, yellow, and bright green. Curved spines protrude from the shoulders, and the wearer’s face is obscured by a strange, bug-eyed mask.

#### Robes of the Violet Citadel
**Armor (cloth), variant (requires attunement), pieces (Robe, skullcap or hood, gloves, boots)**
* *Uncommon.* You have advantage on Stamina saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.
* *Rare.* If possessing two to three set pieces, you have the constant benefits of mage armor, and you gain 10 temporary hit points at the beginning of every day.
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, you always have the following spells prepared: blizzard (at 3rd level), blink step (at 2nd level) and conjure elemental (choose one elemental, spell is 3rd level). Furthermore, you may cast such spells for no cost. You may cast these spells a total of three times before the spell-weaving capabilities of the robes is exhausted until the next dawn.
___
The robes of the magi of the Magical Kingdom of Dalaran are scholars, rulers, and forces that fight evils such as the Burning Legion, the Scourge, and even renegade mages within their own ranks. The Robes of the Violet Citadel are suffused with magical powers that support and protect the magi that earned the right to wear them.

These violet robes are threaded with gold and blue that have high collars, and a black skullcap lined with silver thread (or a wide hood for female magi).

#### Silver Hand Blessed Plate
**Armor (plate), variant (requires attunement), pieces (Plate, gauntlets, greaves, belt)**

\pagebreakNum

* *Uncommon.* If possessing one set piece, you gain 15 temporary hit points at the beginning of every day. These temporary hit points may only be used to reduce damage to your maximum hit points (such as by the draining attacks of undead), and do not apply against normal damage.
* *Rare.* If possessing two or three set pieces, you add the sunbeam spell to your spell list. It is always prepared so long as you wear the armor. If you cannot cast spells, or cannot cast the sunbeam spell yet, you can instead cast it once before a short rest.
* *Epic.* If possessing all set pieces, when you heal a creature with a holy light spell or with your Lay on Hands feature, a radiant burst of light protects them. Hostile creatures within 5 feet of a creature healed by this spell must make an Agility saving throw or be blinded for 1 round. If the hostile creatures are fiends or undead, they may instead take holy damage equal to double the spell’s level or one-quarter of the number of hit points your target regained (your choice for either).
___
This set of armor is worn by the Knights of the Silver Hand in battle, this armor is blessed by the Holy Light to aid the righteous men and women of the Order against evil influences.

Made of steel and silver and gold, and mantled with a blue cloak on one shoulder, the knights of the order fight with the full righteous cause of the Holy Light.

#### Special Potions
Most potions are based on spells as described in Chapter 7. Some potions diverge from this rule, however, and cover areas that are beyond the strength of spells, such as providing rest. Often times, such potions have their own prices instead of conforming to the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table on Chapter 7.

The DCs described under each potion are the default, but any creature with the Alchemy ability can increase the DC to be equal to their potion DCs.

</div>

##### Acid Neutralizer
This lotion can treat an object or a creature. When subject to acid damage, the creature reduces the damage by a number equal to 1d6 + 3 points. This applies once per round. The acid neutralizer remains until 1 hour passes per dose applied.

##### Antiodor
This lotion can treat an object or a creature. When treated, the target’s odor is muffled and neutralized. The creature does not have a normal scent until the lotion fades after 1 hour, or after the creature gains (or excretes) a scent (such as if sweating after running or touching a perfumed object).

This lotion is often employed by rogues who anticipate opposition against creatures with strong olfactory senses, such as bloodhounds or wolves.

##### Antitoxin (or Antiplague)
This vial of antitoxin gives the imbiber advantage to any saving throw against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

Some antitoxins only function against plagues. These are known as antiplagues instead, but provide the same benefit.

##### Crackle Powder
This alchemical powder creates a loud crackling noise, like a snapping branch, whenever it is jostled or struck. A dose of the powder covers a 10-foot-radius area with an action, and imposes disadvantage on Agility (Stealth) checks.

The powder remains active for 4 hours.

##### Crystallized Air
This alchemical item crystallizes breathable air. When consumed, the potion grants 1 hours’ worth of breath in one dosage. Crystallized air is waterproof if unused, but spoils when the creature otherwise opens their mouth or allows new air entry into the body (such as by breathing normally or talking).

\pagebreakNum

##### Dark Light Powder
The gray powder has no special quality when seen in normal light, but glows brightly when viewed in darkvision, despite the surrounding light level.

Each dose contains enough powder for a reasonably lengthy sentence or a moderately-large drawing.

##### Defoliant
This vile liquid has a muddy brown hue and smells of rotten plant life. Contained in one potion flask is enough defoliant to remove plant life from one 5-foot square.

Light vegetation (anything but trees) dies within 1 hour of exposure, leaving behind scarred and sterile soil (as if blighted).

Medium vegetation (anything but massive trees) dies in 2 hours and can be cleared at a rate of 1 hour per 5-foot square.

Large vegetation (including trees) can usually survive a single dose of defoliant, but the dose scars a 5-foot portion of the tree. If it can scar one-half the tree, the tree rots from within and dies.

If targeting a plant creature, this potion harms them, reducing the plant creature’s maximum hit points by 1d4 + 1, halved on a successful Stamina saving throw. This can stack for each application.

An area affected by defoliant can be cleared by a creature proficient in Alchemist’s Supplies or an Herbalist’s Kit. It takes 10 minutes to clear a 5-foot square of defoliant.

##### Flash Powder
This pinch of powder is a mixture of proto-gunpowder and alchemical flares. It can be thrown at a range of 30/60 ft. Creatures 5 feet away from the point of impact are blinded on a failed Agility saving throw against a DC of 10. If thrown further than 30 feet, creatures have advantage to the saving throw. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn every round.

Alchemists, rogues, and hunters often use this cheap product as a distraction to hide or for a quick combat advantage if they have the Flash Bomber talent.

Unlike most potions, flash powder also counts as an explosive, and can be crafted by those proficient with Engineer’s Tools, and can’t be consumed by an alchemical engine.

##### Gunpowder (12 gp)
This potent combustible powder is the fuel for most firearms and explosives, and some combustion engines. Unlike most uncommon alchemical products, gunpowder costs 12 gp per pound in most stores, and costs 6 gp to craft if not a specialist.

When set aflame gunpowder combusts and deals 1d6 fire damage to each creature in 10 feet per 1 pound of mass (up to 10d6 points of fire damage). Setting an ounce of gunpowder causes it to burn brightly, shedding bright light in 30 feet for 1 round, and dim light in the same radius for another round, before extinguishing. A creature in the area of effect can attempt a DC 10 Agility saving throw to half the damage taken.

If set aflame in a container, gunpowder instead deals the damage in concussive damage, and its radius increases by 10 feet for every pound of mass.

Unlike most potions, gunpowder also counts as an explosive, and can be crafted by those proficient with Engineer’s Tools, and can’t be consumed by an alchemical engine.

##### Holy Water
As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon or as a potion (if you are proficient in alchemy). If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 points of holy damage, or takes disadvantage to their next saving throw within 1 hour (your choice).

Holy water can also free corpses from the Scourge’s taint or the Undead Plague if a flask is spent on a creature, preventing it from being reanimated, a discovery made by priestesses of Elune.

A priest, paladin, or shaman may create holy water (or elemental water if a shaman) without using alchemy by performing a special ritual.

The ritual takes costs the same in time and materials as a potion (in powdered silver or herbs) and requires the caster to spend mana equal to a 1st level spell.

##### Mana Potion
By imbibing this blue potion, a spellcaster’s mental fog is cleared as their mind is flooded with a torrent of raw power. By drinking a mana potion, the character regains mana points.
* **Minor (Uncommon).** You regain mana as if you rested for 1 hour.
* **Moderate (Rare).** You regain mana as if you rested for 2 hours.
* **Greater (Legendary).** You regain mana as if you rested for 3 hours.
___
Mana potions are specifically exempt from the mana restoration limit of 1 per hour, but still run the risk of miscibility if used in succession.

Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, water retention, painful rectal itch, hallucination, dementia, psychosis, coma, death, and halitosis. Magic is not for everyone. Consult your doctor before.

##### Phlogiston (10 gp)
This unusually potent combustible is perfect fuel for most combustion engines.

Unlike most uncommon alchemical products, phlogiston costs 10 gp in fire-based and oily materials in most stores, and costs 5 gp to craft.

The recipe for phlogiston is known to most alchemists and scholars who live alongside tinkers (usually selling for about 10-5 gold pieces).

Unlike most potions, phlogiston also counts as an explosive, and can be crafted by those proficient with Engineer’s Tools, and can’t be consumed by an alchemical engine.

##### Potion of Rest
Provides the benefit of a short rest. Can be used once per 24 hours.

##### Potion of Rest, Greater
Provides the benefit of a long rest. Can be used once per 24 hours.

##### Potion of Youth
When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 2d10% in years. You can reach a lower age threshold via this potion (such as from being venerable to middle age, or adulthood to childhood). Your mental scores and abilities are unchanged, but the DM may rule that your physical body changed enough to warrant change in physical ability scores (such as increasing Agility but reducing Strength).

When created, the potion of youth can be instead a potion of aging, in which case it increases your physical age instead of decreasing it. If the physical age is increased beyond your maximum age, you die of old age. Whenever this potion is used, there is a cumulative 10% chance that the potion inverts the intended result.

For instance, an aging wizard that used 3 potions of youth (for 30% chance to invert) could consume another potion of youth but increase their age by 2d10% years.

The potion’s strength is affected by its rarity

| Rarity  | Age |
|:-:|:-:|
| Rare | 1d10% |
| Epic | 2d10% |
| Legendary	| 3d10% |
| Artifact*	| 100% (at any point desired) |

If an artifact, an inversion causes instant death of old age.

#### Firearms and Crossbows
All firearms use combustion engines, while all crossbows use mechanical engines. Due to the properties of both weapons, adding fuel (or reloading) follows simpler mechanisms; firearms need 2 ounces of gunpowder regardless of rarity for every shot, and crossbows require 1 action to reload.

Special modifications and size increases alter actions reloaded.

Firearms and crossbows with special fuel sources are marked with asterisk (*).

##### Air Recycler
This cylinder provides air, as the water breathing spell.

##### Antimagic Ray Gun
When used, this wand-like gun shoots a purple anti-magic ray, as the mana burn spell. Elementals required for the anti-magic ray device are pure mana elementals (such as mana wyrms and arcane elementals), and souls must be of spellcasters. The improved gadget replicates a higher-level mana burn spell.

##### Antimagic Ray Gun, Improved

##### Auto-Factory
Usually employed by goblin tinkers in war, this large object unfolds to resemble a horse-sized factory. The whirrs and whistles inside are indicative of some process within. The factory churns out clockwork goblins, which function for the duration of the factory’s activation (and disintegrate when the factory enters cooldown). The factory has a capacity of 6 clockwork goblins, which can be churned out at once or over time. The constructs conjured by the auto-factory are controlled by the user of the device.

When used, this gadget casts the burning hands spell. When made by goblins, flamethrowers are instead known as dragon guns, with the modifications changed from quick-use to unreliable (MR 1-4) and becoming smaller (light) and 5 lbs. in mass.

##### Flashlight
The flashlight can be aimed and activated with an action. If no malfunction occurs, it emits a 20-foor radius glow of bright light, and emits 20 feet of dim light after that. If directed, it turns instead into a cone with a range of 60 feet of bright light, and 60 feet of dim light afterwards.

\columnbreak

##### Fog Machine
When used, this box creates a billowing sphere-shaped cloud of fog that spreads on a 20-foot radius. The area is heavily obscured, and it remains for a up to 2d4% x 10 minutes or until a moderate or stronger wind disperses it (10 mph+). The cloud of fog is centered on the fog machine, or can be shot out as a large cloud to appear in another area 120 feet away.

##### Force Reflective Disk
This device, based off the re-combobulator, can redirect scattered magical energies back to its source, cancelling the spell.

##### Frost-Me-Up
This harness creates a powerful shield of ice to protect you, as per the ice block spell.

##### Frost Gun
The frost gun can be used with an action, creating a brilliant blue freezing ray up to 30 feet away that creates a 10-foot radius explosion of frozen air to emit from the location of the ray's impact. All creatures hit by the ray or in the explosion's radius must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or else take 4d8 points of cold damage, or half of that on a successful saving throw. If the ray or the radius strikes or includes a body of water or a liquid with similar freezing points, the ray freezes the liquid within its active radius to a depth of 6 inches for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming or that were in the water at the moment must succeed on an additional Strength saving throw as an action against the DC of the device or be restrained. After 1 minute of being conjured, the ice shatters.

##### Glitterbox Surprise
Employed by enterprising goblins to counter porch-thieves, a glitterbox surprise casts the faerie fire spell.

##### Goblin Glider Kit
When deployed, the goblin glider kit creates a goblin glider, as the creature of the same name. Unlike most gadgets, the goblin glider kit can also be used as a reaction.

##### Hologram Generator
This device, based on Naaru technology, can create holograms and light-manipulated images as per the silent image spell.

##### Hologram Generator, Greater

##### Jumper Cables
This pack may be hooked up with any creature that died within one minute. If activated without an issue, the creature is revived, and returned to life with 1 hit point and no mana. This cannot return a creature that died of old age. This gadget requires 300 gold pieces’ worth of focus crystals per use of activation.

\pagebreakNum

##### Launcher, Caltrops
When used, this box releases four bags of caltrops into the air to fall over an area within 30 feet, filling a 10-foot square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Agility saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw. Once used, this can be refilled with replacement caltrops. There is a 75% chance that a used bag of caltrops can be used again.

##### Launcher, Cluster Rockets
This heavy machine is typically set on the floor before the user. When loaded with up to four explosives, it launches them all within their normal range with a single action. This applies to all explosives. A cluster launcher adds 1d6 concussive damage to each explosive used. This otherwise follows rules for the rocket launcher gadget.

##### Launcher, Rocket
This heavy machine is typically set on the user’s shoulder. When loaded with an explosive in bomb or rocket form, it launches it further than its normal range, increasing its original range by 90 feet. This applies to the maximum range it can launch. On impact, any explosive deals an additional 2d6 concussive damage atop the normal damage. If the explosive is in mine form, it can be planted at that range instead of exploding.

##### Launcher, Trap
This heavy machine can lob a trap to up to 90 feet, priming the trap on the point of impact.

On the 5-foot square area of impact, the bomb lands with a stronger explosion, adding 2d6 extra concussive damage. A mortar may be loaded with up to eight pints of oil, and may be used again after 1d4 rounds. The explosive no longer allows advantage on the saving throw for long range use.

##### Noise Canceller Box
This device instantly counters any noise with active noise control, creating counter-waves to remove any semblance of sound and replicating the silence spell.

##### Neuralyzer
This small device, when targeting a creature, can cause neural manipulation as per the modify memory spell.

##### OOBE Simulator
This device puts you and the allies you choose into an Out of Body Experience, as per the astral projection spell.

##### Personal Gravity Suppressor
TODO

##### Pulley Gun
This hand-cannon can shoot one to two ropes at opposite ends. Each rope has a hook at its end, and each extends to up to 90 feet per action of use. If the hooks target an object, they attach to it, and can carry up to 140 pounds of weight. If the hook targets a creature, they take 3d8 piercing damage, and the hooks are destroyed. A pulley gun has a wheel for transport along the ropes, and allows for movement at a rate of 60 feet per round either up or down the ropes’ ends. A pulley gun that shoots one rope but can be used twice is known as a mechanical grappling hook.

##### Re-combobulator
This device can scatter magical energies, replicating the dispel magic spell.

##### Reflective Pole
The reflective pole is a 2-foot long, 8-inch thick cylinder that is usually strapped to the back of the user, and is attached to a winding mechanism near the user's hand. The cylinder can be deployed as a reaction when the user takes elemental damage, unfurling and countering the elemental damage with a sheet of specially-treated and reinforced glass. The user gains resistance to the elemental damage, and the next time the user hits with a melee attack on the next turn, the reflective pole reflects 1d6 points of the absorbed damage to the target of the user's attack. The character must be able to use their hands or similar limbs to deploy the pole.

##### Reflective Pole, Supreme
TODO

##### Remote, Mind
This strange-looking hat has a hypnotic pattern attached to it. When the gadget is active, the mind remote can focus on any person within 30 feet, casting the charm person spell.

\pagebreakNum

##### Remote
This small machine can activate any mine, gadget, or construct that is keyed to it. Keying a technological device to a remote takes one minute and a DC 10 Intelligence check with Engineer’s Tools. If the check resulted in a 20, the keying is instead 1 action. Using a remote is a bonus action on the creature’s round, or a reaction outside their round. A remote can activate any device it is bonded to as long as both of them are within 150 feet of each other. This effect can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. It tied to an explosive that normally explodes on impact, it can hold the explosive until the remote is used (effectively, the bomb is waiting for the signal).

##### Rocket Boots
These heavy boots strapped with a small backpack may be activated with an action. For each use, it gives the user a flying speed of 60 feet, usable for one minute. At the end of the duration, the user falls unless they are on solid ground.

##### Shieldtronic Shield
This harnessed device can spring out with a powerful repelling barrier, increasing your AC as per the shield spell.

##### Spring Boots
Once activated, this pair of springy boots triples your jumping distance for 1 minute.

##### Sonic Gun
TODO

##### Star-in-a-Box
Once activated, this box releases a miniature sphere of energy that bursts forth with the power of a star, casting the sunburst spell.

##### Stopwatch
Theorized to be either based on ancient titan technology or by chaos energies manipulating the timestream, this rather large stopwatch can literally freeze time, as per the time stop spell.

##### Sun Gun
The sun-gun can be focused and used with an action, casting the sunbeam spell.

##### Target Dummy
This target dummy is fueled with sufficient chaos energy (or perhaps simply looks frustrating) that it can distract hostile creatures, casting the compelled duel spell on them.

##### Tectonic Destabilizer
Expanded upon the Titan Terra-Former, the tectonic destabilizer causes earthquakes and fissures to emerge from the ground when activated, casting the earthquake spell.

##### Teleportation Pad
Used by enterprising goblins, the teleportation pad can teleport its user to any other teleportation pad or teleportation circle, so long as the sequence is known. Most teleportation pads have a ‘public’ and ‘private’ pad sequence lists, with some destinations reserved for more trusted travelers.

##### Titan Terraformer
Developed from prototypes of ancient titan technology, this device can manipulate earth, sand, or clay as the move earth spell so long as it is active.

##### Universal Translator
This remote-like device can instantly decipher spoken speech to whoever is holding it. Moreover, when you speak, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear you understands what you say. The device operates for 1 hour.

##### Water Gun
The water pump is a 2-foot long, 8-inch thick cylinder that can hold up to 3 gallons of any liquid (or 16 quarts). The water pump can be used with an action to release one quart of liquid in a line up to 90 feet away, stopping at impact with the first object. The target must succeed on an Agility saving throw or else take 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save and a secondary effect depending on the liquid. A successful save halves the initial damage and negates the secondary effect.
* *Oil.* If the liquid is oil or another flammable liquid, the user may use a bonus action to set the liquid on fire as it is released (necessitating another malfunction check), setting the liquid is set aflame (regardless of malfunction). Targets who failed their save take 1d6 fire damage and are ignited until they extinguish the flame with an action and a successful Agility save (taking an additional 1d6 points of damage per round until they pass a DC equal to the gadget's DC).
* *Water.* If the liquid is water, attack also extinguishes flames. Fire-based creatures or those vulnerable to water take double damage from this and do not employ any resistances towards this damage.
* *Water, Contaminated.* If the liquid is a contaminated water or liquid (such as sewage water), the target must also save versus any contact, injury, or ingested poison or disease that is carried by the water. If using sewage water, the target is most likely to be contaminated by Crypt Fever, Filth Fever, Slimy Doom, and Blinding Sickness (see Contagion for details, duration 7 days), although other diseases or poisons may be built into the waters.

##### World Enlarger
This phenomenally powerful gadget enlarges the whole world for a single target. When used, it casts the reduce person.

##### Wormhole Generator
Tearing a space in dimensions is a breeze with the Wormhole Generator, allowing you and any creatures touching the generator to teleport as the teleport spell.

<div class="classTable wide">

#### Trap Gadgets
Traps are often-hostile gadgets that perform a single use (and are thus priced as consumables). They can be deployed and primed with an action, and they become active after being primed by one round. Whenever a creature moves to 10 feet or closer to a trap, it triggers and discharges its effect. The DCs are equal to that of a device.

Once used, fixing a trap costs half the time and gold to make them.

##### Crippling Trap
This trap unleashes a powerful debilitating effect on the triggering creature for 1 minute. The target suffers a -2 penalty to AC and to Agility saving throws, can’t use its reactions, and may make either an action or a bonus action every turn (not both). Regardless of the creature’s abilities, it may only make one melee or ranged attack on its turn, and they deal only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength or Agility.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Stamina saving throw against the effect. On a success, the cripple effect ends.

##### Freezing Trap
This trap unleashes a super-compressed blast of cold that freezes the triggering creature for 1 minute, and deals 1d8 cold damage. A successful Stamina save halves the damage dealt, and reduces the condition for one round. A creature may use its action to break the ice.

##### Oil Slick Trap
This trap spews slippery oil in a 10-foot radius, rendering it into difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature that either enters the area, is within the radius when the trap is triggered, or ends their turn in the area must make an Agility save or fall prone.

##### Immolation Trap
This trap burns the triggering creature, replicating the immolate sigil spell, with the sigil roll being replaced with the attack bonus (Intelligence plus proficiency in Engineer’s Tools).

##### Toxic Gas Trap
This trap releases a cloud of toxic fumes, replicating the cloudkill spell.

##### Wagon Clamp
This trap clamps down on the triggering creature or vehicle for one minute, dealing 1d8 piercing damage to the wheel (possibly breaking it). While captured, the target is restrained. A successful Stamina saving throw by the vehicle or creature halves the damage dealt and reduces the restraint for one round. A creature may use its action to open the clamp. Most wooden wheels have 5 (2d4) hit points. This is usually used to destroy vehicle wheels, but can be employed as bear traps.

</div>

##### Crippling Poison
A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The Poisoned creature is slowed as the spell of the same name. On a successful saving throw (made only once per turn), the poison ends.

This is a magical manufactured poison, created by mixing deathweed (a natural herb) and essence of pain (a magical component derived from blood of weak demons).

##### Crypt Fever Disease
Any creature that is affected by this disease suffers a weakened immune system, and must succeed on a DC 13 Stamina saving throw against disease or become poisoned until this disease is cured.

So long as the creature is poisoned, they a -2 penalty to all saving throws against disease and poison effects, and suffers two additional points of poison damage if inflicted by any disease or poison.

Symptoms manifest 2d4 hours after infection and include fever and coughing, and while in the grips of this disease, victims’ skins pale.

Any creature comes into touch contact with an infected creature once they begin showing their symptoms must make a DC 8 Stamina saving throw or also become infected with this disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to being infected from that particular infected creature for 24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Stamina saving throw. On a successful save, the penalty to saving throws and additional poison damage taken is reduced by 1 point. When the effect drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.

\columnbreak

##### Exhumed Corpse Fumes
A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage. At the beginning of their turn every round the poison remains active, the character takes 7 (2d6) poison damage again, and is treated as if poisoned until the beginning of their turn the next round. On a successful saving throw, the poison ends.

This is a magical manufactured poison, created by mixing deathweed (a natural herb) and essence of death (a magical component derived from the corpses of burnt undead).

##### Mind-Numbing Poison
A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or take 5 (2d4) psychic damage. At the beginning of every round the poison remains active, the character takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage again, and is distracted. The DC of the distraction is 10 + ½ the damage dealt by this poison. On a successful saving throw, the poison ends.

##### Paralytic Poison
A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The Poisoned creature is paralyzed as the hold spell. On a successful saving throw (made only once per turn), the poison ends.

This is a magical manufactured poison, created by mixing deathweed (a natural herb) and dust of decay (a magical component derived from cremated undead).

##### Serpent Venom
A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Stamina saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

This is a mundane natural poison, created from drawing poison from a snake’s venom sacs. The rarity affects the venom’s power.

\pagebreakNum

| Rarity | Damage |
|:-:|:-:|
| Uncommon | 3d6 |
| Rare | 5d6 |
| Epic | 7d6 |
| Legendary | 9d6 |

##### Shadow Wound Poison
A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The Poisoned creature recovers only one-half the normal amount of healing from spells and effects that restore hit points. This includes regeneration and similar effects, doubling the duration between healing (alternatively, halving the healing gained).

##### Truth Serum
A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Stamina saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The Poisoned creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a Zone of Truth spell.

This is a magical manufactured poison, created by mixing peacebloom (a natural herb) and essence of mana (a magical component derived from blood of spellcasters).

##### Undead Plague
Any creature that is affected by this disease must succeed on a DC 15 Stamina saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured.

Every 24 hours that elapse while poisoned, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (2d4) on a failure. This is considered a poison effect, and resistance against poison halves the reduction. The disease cannot reduce the target’s maximum hit points below 1, but if the creature dies and the disease remains uncured, it rises as an undead creature bound to the service of the Lich King as if the bind spell was cast on within 1 hour, so long as it is not revived or resurrected. If targeted with an conjure undead spell, the duration becomes instantaneous. If the corpse is targeted with a flask of holy water, the creature does not raise as an undead after death.

If succeeding on three saving throws, the disease becomes latent, but does not fade away. So long as the disease remains, the reduction to maximum hit points cannot be removed, and it can be awakened again by another dose of the plague. This disease, despite being ingested, corrupts the air and earth it affects, affecting any exposed food with the plague. When particles of the plague fall on the earth, strange fungus grows, giving a hint to the disease’s origin. This land is considered blighted (as per the hallow/unhallow spell, although the land is not also unhallowed).

The plague can be suppressed with the lesser restoration spell or a restoration spell, and the reduction to maximum hit points can also be removed with the greater restoration spell, but the plague cannot be cured save by a wish spell or the divine intervention ability (if it opposes that of the semi-divine Lich King).

This is a magical manufactured disease, created by an unknown fungus and suffused with necromantic magic. So far, only the Cult of the Damned (or those who infiltrated its alchemist and necromancer ranks) know how to make it.

# Chapter 6: Customization Options

<a id="customization"></a>

## Multiclassing
Multiclassing in Warcraft works as in core 5e.

There are many instances in lore where a character has training in two distinct classes (such as the legendary paladin Uther Lightbringer, who, having trained as a knight, adding the experience of a priest before being called a paladin). Multiclassing is a viable tool to replicate special classes, concepts, or characters who seem to have abilities from several classes.

For instance, the night elven Wardens and high elven Farstriders seem to be both rogues and hunters.

Tauren chieftains also seem to be both warriors with minor affinity to shamanism.

Demon hunters may also augment their tracking abilities by taking a level in hunter, just as enhancement shamans may augment their martial power by taking a level in warrior and choosing specific talents.

## Changing Classes
Several classes intersect in theme with others. A character may change their class to another one near them after accomplishing a quest and undergoing character development.

| Old Class  | New Class |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| Alchemist | Tinker | 
| Paladin | Death Knight | 
| Shaman and Mage | Warlock | 

### Attribute Change
Changing from a casting class to another with a different spellcasting ability score also affects the creature’s mental abilities.

If you have different spellcasting ability scores, you may move up to 4 ability score points from the old class’s spellcasting ability score to the new class’s spellcasting ability score. The old attribute cannot end up lower than 8, or higher than 18 (before applying increases from race, class, feats, etc.). The ability score total that can be changed is 4 (or one-half the character’s total level from the old class, whichever is higher)

For example, turning from a shaman to a warlock, for instance, drains Spirit and bolsters Charisma as fel magic suffuses the shaman’s being. If the shaman (16 Spirit, 12 Charisma) chooses to start turning her back on the elements and kneeling to the Burning Legion, her journey to becoming a Warlock begins, moving up to 4 points from Spirit to Charisma (for a total of 12 Spirit, 16 Charisma). If the shaman was level 20, she can move up to 10 points instead (10 Spirit, 18 Charisma, as Charisma cannot be higher than 18 before modifications are applied).

Changing from a class to another in downtime is also viable, as is changing a talent chosen or a general decision (such as feat taken, fighting style, archetype, etc.).

This is resolved as normal downtime training to learn a new language or training with a set of tools (takes 250 days, and costs 1 gp per day), although the DM may reduce the time to train dramatically with a quest or event (subject to shared adjudication).

## Feats

<a id="feats"></a>

___
**Strike feats**
<br>
These are effects that modify a successful attack roll and cost a bonus action. If a strike effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + proficiency bonus + Strength (or Agility if using a finesse or light weapon).

##### Alchemical Aptitude
**Prerequisites: Intelligence 13 or higher.**
<br>
You gain proficiency in Alchemist’s Supplies, and the Alchemy ability (with an effective caster level of 1).

You gain three potion recipes from the Alchemist spell lists, and can store them in an alchemist’s formula book, and scribe them in any language you know.

Hunters and Rogues often choose from the following: Alchemists acid, alchemist’s fire, alchemist’s frost, false life potion, healing potion, poison spray potion, rejuvenation potion (sometimes known as a crimson vial) or smoke bomb.

Warriors often choose from the following: Alchemists acid, alchemist’s fire, alchemist’s frost, false life potion, healing potion, heroism potion, or rejuvenation potion (sometimes known as a crimson vial)

Undead characters often take potions of death coil as healing potions instead.

##### Attuned Spell
**Prerequisite: Access to 1st level spells**
<br>
You attune your spellcasting capabilities to a small number of specific spells, and are much more capable in casting them, at the cost of your flexibility in choosing which spells you can cast. You can choose up to three spells, and each of them are cast for 2 less mana points (minimum 1). You can change these spells by retraining (treating your spellcaster level as the relevant level).

You cannot attune to any spell that is a minor spell for you (see Chapter 10), a spell that has ‘mana’ in its name or affects mana points (such as mana burn, drain mana or mana shield), one whose mana cost is lesser than those of comparable level (such as strike and stance spells, or shadow bolt), or a spell that relies on, casts, or replicates another spell (such as conjure strike, glyph of warding, or wish).

This feat is sometimes known as spell mastery or favored spell, and is historically one of the reasons human spellcasters were able to compete with non-human spellcasters with few iconic spells.

Despite the name of this ability, this does not consume attunement slots and do not count as attuned items.

##### Brew Mastery
**Prerequisites: Ki**
<br>
You gain proficiency in brewer supplies.

Also, if you have the Ki feature, you may imbue a pint of drink (alcohol, tea, or any other brew) with a measure of your Ki, reducing your current and maximum Ki pool by the amount of points you use.

The drink is suffused with your power, and confers a benefit to whoever drinks it. Drinking a brew is a bonus action, and grants one of the below benefits for eight hours, until they take a long rest, or until they make use of three uses of the effect (whichever comes first). After the drink is consumed, your Ki maximum is restored to normal (and can

\pagebreakNum

rest to regain the lost Ki). A creature cannot benefit from more than one brew at any given time, and cannot benefit if they do not require drink or food to stay alive, or if they cannot reasonably process drinks. The brew can also be force-consumed with a melee unarmed attack or as part of a grapple check.

You gain two brew recipe upon gaining this feat, and may learn more by finding recipes throughout the world or by training.
* Fortifying Brew (1 Ki point). All creatures who drink this brew increase their maximum hit points by 1 per monk level (max is equal to double the imbiber’s original hit points). If the character later suffers from a reduction to maximum hit points, it is reduced from the benefit of Fortifying Brew first. This benefit ends if the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. This does not stack with aid spell.
* Elusive Brew (1 Ki point). All creatures who drink this brew can use a reaction to perform the Dodge action. Each reaction is a single use.
* Dizzying Haze (1 Ki point). All creatures who drink this brew suffer from light obstruction to perception, and lose 10 feet of speed for one minute. The creature can make a Stamina saving throw to negate the obstruction to vision and negate the reduction to speed. If targeted with a fire spell or effect, the creature suffers from the burning condition, but takes 1d4 points of fire damage instead of 1d6. The target can attempt an Agility saving throw against your ki DC to avoid suffering the burning condition. Unlike most brews, the benefit of this brew can be used once.
* Mana Tea (2 Ki). All creatures who drink this brew can regain 2 Ki, or 2 points of mana. As normal mana regeneration effects, this effect has a cooldown of an hour (even if used for Ki). Unlike most brews, the benefits of this brew can be used once.
* Thunder Focus Tea (2 Ki). All creatures who drink this brew reduce the mana or Ki cost for area-of-effect and multi-target spells by 1 point (minimum 1 mana, minimum 0 Ki). Each reduction is one use.
* Tigereye Brew (1 Ki). All creatures who drink this brew can add their Spirit bonus to melee weapon damage rolls. Each application is one use.
* Ki Guard Brew (2 Ki). All creatures who drink this brew take 2 less points of damage from weapon attack rolls. This is an aura bonus. Each reduction is one use.
___
You may brew and imbue as much drinks as your Ki allows, though the ki dissipates naturally over the course of three days. This is considered a ki feature, and has the same DC to resist.

##### Fel Suffusion
**Prerequisites: Access to 1st level spells and either the ability to cast spells that deal fel damage or having mana siphoned a fiend**
<br>
As a bonus action, you can suffuse the invasive corruption of fel magic into your spells. When a spell you cast is enhanced this way, you can ignore the spell resistance feature, or treat your spell’s level as if two spell levels higher for the purposes of spell immunities, dispel, and other variables. You can use this feat a number of times equal to your Spellcasting ability modifier. All uses are replenished after a long rest. You can regain one use if you perform mana siphon (mana vampirism) upon a fiend. You cannot suffuse spells that do (or can) deal holy damage.

\columnbreak

##### Fiendish Fury
**Prerequisite: The ability to cast the berserker frenzy spell or benefitting from it at least once.**
<br>
When under the effects of the berserker frenzy spell, your anger manifests in an aura of fel flame, dealing 1d4 fel damage to creatures that start their turn adjacent to you.

As a strike effect, you may also add this damage to your melee weapon attacks once per turn. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while raging in this case, you may instead be reduced to 1 hit point and gain one level of exhaustion. The level of exhaustion is added 1 minute after you end your rage. If you would be killed, you instead gain three levels of exhaustion.

You can continue to stack levels of exhaustion this way, in which case they all apply once your rage ends (unless otherwise mitigated by some other means).

##### Infusionist
**Prerequisite: Four or more caster levels, Intelligence 15 or higher**
<br>
You gain proficiency with the infusion skill and can make infused items.

##### Magical Suffusion
**Prerequisite: Ability to cast arcane or divine spells, access to cantrips**
<br>
You gain increased proficiency with cantrips. Your cantrips count as if you are 4 levels higher to determine the damage dealt with them.

You prepare one additional cantrip (total is your proficiency bonus + 1). Furthermore, cantrips never cost mana for you.

##### Multiclass Synergy
**Prerequisites: At least two levels in two different classes**
<br>
You can unerringly mix disciplines you are proficient with. Choose two classes you have at least two levels in. Each two levels from one class counts as one effective level to the other for the purposes of improving existing abilities that scale on class level (such as Second Wind, Sneak Attack, and Martial Arts). This includes the Spellcasting feature, where you can add caster levels from different classes (therefore, 1 full caster level from the mage class, and ½ a caster level from the hunter class). If you are a spellcaster who multiclasses with a non-spellcasting class, count one-half the other class’s level as an increase to your caster level (treating it as if it provided 0.5 caster levels).

This does not grant access to new abilities, nor stack with existing improvements from multiclassing. You may choose improved progression, however, when counting your effective caster level.

For this purpose, Talents, Archetype features, ability score improvements, and improvements to Extra Attack are treated as new features, and cannot be gained by synergy.

For instance, the Warrior's Second Wind heals 1d10 + your warrior level when used. If you have 5 levels in warrior and 4 in hunter, and have taken this feat, Second Wind restores 1d10 + 7 hit points (5 warrior levels, plus 2 effective warrior levels from 4 hunter levels). Your effective caster level for hunter spells becomes 4 (2 from hunter, 2 from warrior).

\pagebreakNum

##### Mystic Blast
**Prerequisite: Ability to cast arcane or divine spells**
<br>
You gain the ability to unleash latent magic as a ranged or touch attack. As an Action, you can unleash a Mystic Blast, which can be at a range of Touch or up to 20 feet (plus 10 feet per maximum spell level accessible, up to 110 feet at 9th level).

Upon a successful attack roll, the blast deals 1d6 points of damage, chosen from the following: acid, cold, lightning, or fire. For every spell level you access, this deals an extra 1d6 (up to 9d6 at 9th level)

You may alternatively choose one of the following magic damage types (arcane, fel, holy, psychic, thunder, or shadow) for your Mystic Blast, but you must have a spell with such descriptors prepared, and it deals 1d4 damage instead (up to 9d4 at 9th level).

This does not cost mana, and can be done at will as a supernatural ability, so long as you have at least 1 mana point in reserve for each dice of damage.

If you are exhausted from low mana, you cannot make use of this ability unless you are no longer exhausted.

This counts as a spell for the purposes of the Spell Strike feat.

This feat can be taken multiple times.
___
**Mystic Blast Augmentations**
<br>
Whenever the feat is possessed more than once (such as by taking the feat more than once, having an ability that would give you Mystic Blast, etc.), you gain a Mystic Blast augmentation chosen from the list below. You can have multiple augmentations.
* *Attuned.* Your Mystic Blast can be used as an Attack action, but only once per turn. If taken again, this allows one extra attack action to be turned into a Mystic Blast.
  Empowered. Your Mystic Blast deals 50% extra damage. This can stack.
  Innate. Your Mystic Blast requires no mana in reserve (but still cannot be used when exhausted from low mana).
* *Maneuvering.* A single target of your Mystic Blast is subject to a Shove attempt (using your Spell Attack roll as the contested roll). If taken twice, this both pushes and knocks prone on a successful roll. The distance pushed is equal to 5 feet per three spell levels accessed (minimum 5 feet, maximum 15 feet).
* *Reacting.* When targeted by a Mystic Blast or ability that deals the same damage type as of your Mystic Blast, you can use Mystic Blast as a reaction against the source that targeted you. If you desire, the damage from your Mystic Blast can reduce the damage you would have taken from the ability. If this reduces the damage to 0, you retain use of your reaction and have not spent it.
* *Splitting.* Your Mystic Blast can spread its damage across multiple targets. You can freely split the damage (in any amount you wish) between up to one target per spell level accessed, so long as the targets are within 30 feet of one another. If taken again, this doubles the splitting range.

##### Improved Regeneration
**Prerequisite: Troll, Stamina of 13 or higher**
<br>
You increase your Stamina score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

You regain 1 hit point at the end of each hour, provided you have at least 1 hit point remaining.

You regenerate lost limbs in three days instead of one week, unless they were taken willingly (such as to escape bonds), or if they are cauterized.

##### Shroud of the Ancients
**Prerequisites: Night Elf race**
<br>
Your link to the ancients increases in strength. The ancients grant their blessing upon you, granting you the following abilities.

You may Dash as a bonus action when you are not in bright light.

Your Shadowmeld ability instead grants you concealment. This requires you to remain in the same circumstances that allow Shadowmeld, and cannot be used twice in the same minute.

You may invoke the blessings of the ancients to cast the disguise self spell once per short rest. This can be invoked only in a place where your Shadowmeld could be used, but can be maintained when leaving such areas.

##### Spell Strike [Strike]
When you make a melee or ranged weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to apply the effects of a direct-target spell to the struck creature. The spell targets the creature struck, and cannot target anyone else, such as you, an area, or an adjacent creature. The creature is still entitled a saving throw if the spell allows it, but if the spell targets AC, the effect does not call for another roll.

This is declared before the strike is made, and a spell that is designated to discharge is lost harmlessly if the attack fails. The range of the spell increases to become the range of the attack (a shocking grasp spell cast through a spell strike via an arrow will deal damage normally if the hit lands).

The extra spell damage is not increased if the attack is a critical hit.

This feat cannot be applied to a strike spell.

##### Spell Stance [Stance]
As a bonus action, you may enter a spell stance. As part of entering this stance, you may cast a spell on yourself, so long as the spell’s original casting time is equal to one action or is shorter.

So long as you remain in the spell stance, the spell remains active, up to its normal duration or ending parameters.

The spell requires the normal mana cost or resources, and must be a spell that can target you or a touched creature. If the spell is an instantaneous spell, you may cast it on yourself again as a bonus action in the next round so long as you remain in the stance.

Only you benefit from the spell woven into the stance, even if the spell was originally an area spell or a spell that affects multiple targets (in which case you are the only available target). If you enter a different stance, all the benefits of the spell stance end prematurely (as if the duration ended or as if you lost concentration, whichever appropriate).

Examples for such uses are the holy light spell to heal yourself, the blade ward spell to ward off weapon strikes, or the general ‘buff spells’ such as see invisibility, haste, tongues, or shield of faith.

##### Titan-Born
**Prerequisites: Dwarf race**
<br>
Your link to the ancient earthen and your titanic progenitors increases in strength. Your skin is no longer strictly flesh, but acts as if malleable and flexible metal or stone. You gain the following abilities.

You may use your Stoneform ability up to three times before a rest.

\pagebreakNum

You are immune to the petrified condition, and can hold your breath up to 15 minutes.

You know the mold earth cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast thunderwave as a 1st level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the earthen grasp spell as a 2nd level spell.

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these abilities (even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities (and after using them for one hour), your skin glows a pale blue. If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level), they are always prepared for free.
___
*Special.* If you are a Dark Iron Dwarf, you can choose to forgo the thunderwave and earthen grasp spells to the hellish rebuke and flaming sphere spells, respectively.

##### Wolf-Born
**Prerequisites: Worgen race**
<br>
Your inner wolf manifests in a more pronounced way, and are able to take control of the curse.

You gain a +1 bonus to your Strength and +1 bonus to your Agility scores.

You increase your walking speed by 5 feet.

Your Worgen Form racial ability has both the benefits of Embrace the Beast and Reject the Beast.

\pagebreakNum

# Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores, Skills, and Tools
To better facilitate and replicate the ability to craft, mine, and refine materials into weapons, there are a few changes to the skill system, by including Gathering and Refining skills.
___
**Ability Proficiency and Expertise**
<br>
In this system, Expertise as a term compasses all instances where a character adds double their Proficiency Bonus to a check.

## Crafting
Most crafting tools are also artisan tools, and require proficiency in the tools used, but some are given to or restricted by race, class, or feature only (the Engineer’s Tools and Infusion Kit).

| Artisan Tool | Task Performed |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| Alchemist’s Supplies | Creates potions, elixirs, and concoctions |  
| Engineer’s Tools<sup>R</sup> | Creates constructs, gadgets, firearms, and bombs | 
| Herbalism Kit | Creates minor potions from herbalism. |  
| Infusion Kit<sup>R</sup> | Creates infusion matrixes that are applied on weapons, etc. | 
| Jewelcrafting Kit | Creates jewelry | 
| Leatherwork Kit | Creates leather-based items and armors | 
| Poisoner’s Kit | Creates poisons and plagues | 
| Smithing Tools | Creates weapons, armor, and metallic trinkets | 
| Tailoring Kit | Creates cloth-based items (such as clothes, boots, and hats) | 
___
**I.** Proficiency in Alchemist’s Supplies can be improved with the Alchemy ability (see below).
<br>
**R.** Proficiency in Engineer’s Tools and the Infusion Kit are restricted to abilities granting proficiency.


### Crafting Rules
Crafting takes four components:
* Time roughly equivalent to the complexity of the end product.
* Raw materials equal to one-half that of the end product (round fractions down).
* Proficiency with the tools (or skill) relevant.
* Success on the Crafting check (if required by the DM).
___
At the end of the allotted crafting time, and if the check is successful, the user crafts the item in question.

| Complexity Class | Example | Crafting Time | DC |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Very Simple | Stick, Ball of Yarn | 10 minutes | 7 |
| Simple | Simple weapon | 1 hour | 10 |
| Moderate | Martial weapon, Light armor | 1 day | 13 |
| Complex | Medium armor, Lock | 1 week | 16 |
| Highly complex | Heavy armor, Construct | 2 weeks | 19 |
___
Per stage above highly complex (or Highly Complex II, etc.), the time doubles per increment (1 month, 2 months, 3 months, etc.), although the DC does not increase.

Crafting takes the specified time, cut down to the nearest ten minutes. Succeeding against the crafting DC by 10 points or more reduces the crafting time by half.

For example, a rogue (if proficient with smith’s tools), can begin to forge a dagger (simple weapon) if she has access to all the tools she needs. As a simple complexity item, it would take her one hour if she has all the required materials and succeeds on a DC 10 Crafting check. If she rolls a natural 20 or gets a result equal to or higher than 20, it takes only 30 minutes.

## Discovery
Making new spells, alchemical formulae, and blueprints for engineering are all highly complicated tasks. It takes downtime and money to research appropriate to formula itself.
___
**Downtime.** It takes 2 weeks per spell level, or 1 week per rarity step of the device.
<br>
**Money.** It takes 50 gp per spell level (if a spell, alchemical formula, or gadget), or 75 gp per rarity step of any device that is not a gadget (which uses the spell calculation instead).
___
An infusion matrix may require the crafting cost of an item of the matrix’s quality in research reagents, or may require the destruction of such a matrix to extract knowledge of how to create it. The DM may impose additional requirements, such as requiring an elemental crystal for a flamethrower (elemental engine) or a blueprint of a normal vehicle to make a similar design.

Instead of researching a new spell, a character can research a creature’s name to conjure it. This takes the same amount of time, and the character can only research a name of a creature they are of sufficient power to conjure (CR equal to highest-level spell). Other stronger names require subjecting yourself to the risks of a Call or by learning the information another way.

\pagebreakNum

<div class="classTable wide">

## Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table
Items have cost to create in materials and gold, scaling with its quality or rarity. The below table includes the cost for material per quality, but is modified further per type of material (or crafting class, such as consumable, use-item, infused item, or creature).

For instance, a Common rarity consumable costs 20 gp to buy (unmodified base price), but a Common creature costs 500 gp (x25 due to being a creature).

Item quality usually also scales with complexity, but only when specified in the description of the tool or product.

| Item Quality | Proficiency | Spell Level: max CR<sup>2</sup> | Dice<sup>3</sup> |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Common | +2/Apprentice | Cantrip: CR ¼ - ½ | 2/3 |
| Uncommon | +2/Apprentice | 1-2 | 3/5 |
| Rare | +3/Journeyman | 3-4 | 4/7 |
| Epic | +4/Expert | 5-6 | 5/9 |
| Legendary<sup>4</sup> | +5/Artisan | 7-8 | 6/11 |
| Artifact | +6/Master | 9+ | 7/13 |

| Class (gp) | Common | Uncommon | Rare | Epic | Legendary | Artifact |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Consumables | 20 | 80 | 320 | 1,280 | 5,120 | 20,480 |
| Use-Items | 200 | 800 | 3,200 | 12,800 | 51,200 | 204,800 |
| Infused Items	| 500 | 2,000 | 8,000 | 32,000 | 128,000 | 512,000 |
| Creatures | 500 | 2,000 | 8,000 | 32,000 | 128,000 | 512,000 |
___
**1** This is the base cost of purchase with most vendors for an item (such as consumables) in gold pieces. An item’s cost can always be paid with raw or refined materials that are appropriate to the type of creation (such as the heart of a fire elemental for a flamethrower gadget).
<br>
**2** This determines the spell levels and maximum CR of a creature-class item by item quality. The values of Maximum CR range between two numbers values; the lower one is 50% cheaper than the higher one. For instance, a Common ¼ creature is worth 125 gp in materials to craft, while ½ is 250.
<br>
**3** Dice represents the number of base number of dice the item would deal in damage if made into a firearm (first number) and explosive (second). For instance, Uncommon firearms deal 3 dice of base damage, while Uncommon explosives deal 5 dice of base damage. Modified crossbows act as firearms, but deal 1 less dice in damage to offset their advantages.
<br>
**4** Legendary and higher rarity items usually also require a quest to attune it to some magical source, such as the High Elven Sunwell, the Scourge's Frozen Throne, an elemental plane's core, or the Night Elves' World Tree. In the case of devices, this might rely on massive joined efforts by organizations (such as the Tinker’s Union of the Kezan goblins or one of the many tinkers guilds) or the employment of schematics derived from Titan technology. This is subject to the DM's discretion. Artifacts also usually require a lengthy quest that might alter the setting as a whole, and are usually infused by creatures of great power. The cost of larger objects increases the cost by 50% per size category.

</div>

### Crafting Classes
There are four crafting classes, which modify the base price in the Item Creation Complexity Table.
Consumables. This class includes any item that has one use and is unusable afterwards (such as potions, poisons, an engineered explosive, or an innovated item). The price of consumables is not modified and is equal to the value under Cost in the above table. Infused items that are consumables (such as infused ammunition and spell scrolls) have the cost of a consumable.

* *Use-Items.* This class includes any gadget or device or weapon-like object created by alchemy or engineering, such as engineered firearms and modified crossbows. The price of use-items is x10 times the cost of a consumable of the same rarity.
* *Infused Items.* This includes all wondrous items and infused weapons and armor, as well as other items created by Infusion Kits that do not fall under another class (such as consumables). The price of infused items is x25 times the cost of a consumable of the same rarity.
* *Creatures.* This includes all creatures created by alchemy or engineering (such as golems, turrets, homunculi, etc.). The price of a creature is x25 times the cost of a consumable of the same rarity.

For instance, purchasing a Common quality Alarm Stick costs 20 gp, while crafting it costs 10 gp in alchemical components and materials. If the character is a specialized crafter (such as a 2nd level Alchemist), crafting it costs 5 gp instead.

The Alchemist and Tinker class are specialized crafters. Upon gaining the Efficient Alchemy and Efficient Engineering features, respectively, they further reduce crafting costs to one-quarter rather than one-half buying price.

\pagebreakNum

For instance, purchasing a Common quality Alarm Stick costs 20 gp, while crafting it costs 10 gp in alchemical components and materials. If the character is a specialized crafter (such as a 2nd level Alchemist), crafting it costs 5 gp instead.
___
*Note.* If being proficient with Herbalism Kit, a character can still craft Potions of Healing (of all types), but the price is multiplied by 2 (for 40 gp purchase from an herbalist, 20 gp craft).
This does not require the recipe for the Potion of Healing, but it is required if using Alchemist’s Supplies (even if also proficient with an Herbalism Kit).

## Tools: Gathering
Due to the costs of crafting, few characters pay directly in raw materials and gp, especially those who are short on liquid wealth. For them, proficiency in gathering tools, harvesting nodes from monsters and locations (such as rare beasts and groves of natural materials), and scavenging materials from potions or devices they don’t need (or ones that are looted) is a cost-effective alternative.

For instance, a party of adventurers who defeat a harvest golem in Westfall might choose to deconstruct it if they have a tinker, so that the tinker can use its parts for devices that aid their quests. Coming across a cache of potions of dragons’ breath, an alchemist may decide to repurpose the potions and turn them into rejuvenation potions instead of paying the cost of potion creation.

Any tool that allows for the collection or preservation of raw materials may be used to gather raw materials. These raw materials have a value that can be spent for crafting, such as alchemy (Alchemy Points), engineering (Engineering Points), Infusion (Infusion Points), or other crafting tools.

| Artisan Tools | Task Performed |
|:-:|:-:|
| Mining tools | Collects metals, identifies metals and minerals, and general mining |  
| Skinning tools | Collects hides, skins, and identifies quality of leather. |

### Harvesting Nodes
A DM is recommended to place minor and major nodes on the game map or reference it to important areas. As nodes, they usually attract attention of other characters and creatures, such as golems and spellcasters in places where infusion points are, and fey and druids where alchemical materials are. Most nodes take a day to harvest materials from. Multiple characters can harvest from the same node.

Engineering materials (or appropriate base materials) can be drawn from mines or mining nodes, where kobolds, miners, and dwarves live, or are generated workshops. Nodes can be rewards for quests, and can be referenced in-character.

#### Node Size
**Minor Node.** 250 gp of materials/day (two uses, rarely replenish)

Minor nodes are minor harvesting deposits. These are usually expended and replenish slowly over time or with DM discretion, but also include minor pools of mana, minor ley lines (for infusion), a small to medium busy engineering workshop or junkyard (for engineering), or a copse or forest grove filled with alchemical plants (for alchemy).

\columnbreak

There is usually at least one minor node present within 12 miles from one another.
___
**Moderate Node.** 500 gp of materials/day (four uses, replenish every month)

Moderate nodes include centers of power such as mana fountains, moon wells, or a ley line intersection (for infusion), a large engineering workshop or junkyard (for engineering), and an alchemical ingredient farm or a grove (for alchemy). There is usually a moderate node present within 100 miles of one another.
___
**Major Node.** 1,000 gp of materials/day (eight uses, replenish every month)

Major nodes are usually sparse, rarely appearing more than five known instances. This includes the literal center of ley lines on a planet, a major mine system that accesses extremely rare metals, or the center of an ancient, magical forest blessed by the fey and gods. There is usually one major node per region. Major nodes are usually also seats of powers for major organizations, or are a battlefield for major powers to contest over.

Examples are Tower of Karazhan, the Sunwell, the Tree of Eternity, Blackrock Spire, and the Maelstrom for Infusion Points. A DM may reward a crafting class with access to a node, such as a mage tower built atop a mana fountain.

For instance, a 1st level warrior proficient in mining tools, for example, can spend a day in a minor node (an iron mine), harvesting 250 gp worth of materials after working, which can be invested in making any iron-based weapon.

#### Monster Nodes
Some monsters act as nodes. A monster that is harvested for a particular body part has the rest of its body parts damaged in the attempts to extract value. The time it takes to harvest is decided jointly between the DM and the player.

If harvesting a Consumable the monster naturally creates (such as a poison), one dose can be created per Hit Dice with no cost with a given success (if medium sized). A monster that can be harvested usually shows signs of it, and are described as such. A single monster of the below proficiency can provide materials for a number of items of the below listed quality. For each size category of difference, the dosage is a fraction smaller or doubled in quantity (a small venomous spider gives one-half a dose per Hit Dice, while a wyvern gives two doses per hit dice).

#### Gathering Raw Materials on the Field
This use allows the user to gather materials over time. This is markedly less efficient than extracting from a node. The user can spend one day of downtime in gathering. This does not include paying lifestyle expenses or upkeep (which must be paid normally).

| Proficiency | Materials/day | Materials/week |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| +2 | 1 gp | 7 gp |
| +3 | 7 gp | 50 gp |
| +4 | 25 gp | 175 gp |
| +5 | 100 gp | 700 gp |
| +6 | 375 gp | 2,625 gp |

The nature of the materials gathered are judged jointly by the DM and the harvester, who decide upon the materials (engineering, infusion, alchemy, etc.) you acquired, judging by the environment, resources, and skill used.

\pagebreakNum

For instance, a 5th level druid proficient in an herbalism kit, for example, can spend a week on harvesting minerals from assorted herb locations or from small gardens, gaining 50 gp worth of alchemical materials (sufficient for crafting an uncommon potion; or 40 gp worth).

If in an enchanted grove, this acts as a node instead (see Harvesting Nodes), and has much better yield.

#### Harvester Proficiency
If the harvester’s proficiency is less than the target monster’s proficiency, this requires a DC 20 ability check with the harvesting tool. On a failed check, half of all the potential materials are lost, and the character can make another attempt (each time halving, until it can provide only 1 gp worth of materials).

The materials drawn from a creature is equal to one-half the XP value of the creature in gold pieces.

For instance, a CR 15 Dragon yields 13,000 XP when defeated, which translates to 6,500 gp worth of draconic materials. That may cover the cost of one Legendary consumable (such as a 7th level Firestorm Potion called ‘Dragonwrath’) or 1/5th a Epic infused item.

Alchemists and Tinkers also have a feature that would enhance the value of materials they would otherwise gain from harvesting (which would multiply the value by 3, or 150% of the XP value of the creature).

#### Willing Harvest
A creature may choose to donate their blood or replaceable body parts for the purposes of harvesting crafting materials, but can only donate up to 1/24th their normal material every month (or their full material value once every two years). Doing this on extended durations usually causes exhaustion or death (even if the creature is normally immune to exhaustion), subject to DM’s discretion.

Should a CR 15 dragon decide to donate some of their blood every month, it would be equal to 270 gp worth of materials (1/48th their XP value), or 405 gp worth if administered by a specialist harvester.
Materials derived from dragons, for instance, can be usually used to create armor (from leather or bone), weapons (for bone weapons), alchemy mixtures (enchanted dragon blood), and fire-based infusions, while constructs’ materials can be used to create armor (from metallic plating), weapons, engineering devices (any), and infusion matrixes (if the construct had magical ability or a magical engine).

#### Scavenging or Dismantling
A crafter can also harvest the materials from an item they destroy. The crafter gains 1/2 the crafting value of a dismantled item (or 1/4th the purchase value). The material is usually called diffusion dust (Infusion), dismantled scrap (Engineering), or deconstructed reagents (Alchemy).

This process is a simple complexity task (1 hour). At the end of the duration, the item is destroyed, and the crafter gains half the value in materials invested to create it (usually related to similar items).
___
**Infusion Drain.** Upon the destruction of a legendary item or artifact, it has a 50% chance of dropping infusion dust relevant, even if not intentionally diffused. Attuned items cannot be diffused unless their attuned character is slain, or when the attunement is willingly surrendered (does not require an action), unless the infusionist can succeed on 3 contested Spirit saving throws against the owner. This check can be done once per year against a single character.

Disenchanting legendary or artifact items also usually requires a quest or a journey to where the item was created, subject to DM discretion, or the listed process of destruction (if available).

## Tools: Production
Any tool that can create a product out of materials is classified as a production skill. The time it takes to make a product and the raw materials it takes depends on the cost of the item and its complexity.

This chapter details how to use production tools. The products themselves are found in Chapter 5: Equipment.

### Alchemist’s Supplies
Having proficiency in Alchemist's Supplies allows you to craft magical potions that hold the power of a spell within them.

Any character who has access to a spell and the Alchemy ability can craft potions of spells they have the formula of (such as spells scribed in spellbooks). The Alchemist class does not need to spend mana to prepare spells into potions, and have their own spell list for potions.

If you have neither a caster level nor the Alchemy feature, but have proficiency in Alchemist’s Supplies, you treat your caster level as 1, and access to one spell list you have or the Alchemist spell list (if you don’t have a spell list).

You cannot make potions of level higher than 1st level.

#### Brewing Potions
Brewing a potion costs the same resources as casting the spell normally in material components (or mana, if required), and costs crafting materials (which can be either in herbs, harvested materials from monsters, or gold pieces in a settlement that can reasonably have the required materials).
___
**Prerequisites.** Alchemy requires at least 1 level in a spellcasting class (or 1 level in the Alchemist class) and proficiency in the tools.
___
**Activation.** A potion can be used with a Use Object action, such as drinking a bottle's contents, coating a spray on the user, or spreading an oil on an object or weapon. Normally, this requires a touch or the range of 5 ft.
___
**Throwing a Potion** Potions can also be thrown to release their effect on impact, in which case they are a thrown improvised weapon at a range of 20/60 ft. If the spell originally affects an area, the potion affects the area as well. This either requires an attack roll (or spell attack roll) or a DC.
___
**Spell Attack.** The character can add their proficiency bonus to attack if they are proficient in Alchemist's Supplies. For instance, the alchemist's fire potion stores the fire bolt cantrip, dealing 1d10 fire damage to the target it hits. This can be an attack roll (or spell attack, if possessing the Alchemy ability).
___
**Spell save DC.** The potion’s DC is specified on creation. If the creator is a spellcaster or has the Alchemy ability, the DC is equal to the Spell save DC.

If thrown beyond its optimal range, the attack suffers disadvantage as normal (if a ranged attack), or the target has advantage on their saving throw (if a saving throw is required).

\pagebreakNum

**Spell Casting Time.** If the spell stored in the potion has a casting time more than 1 action, the spell begins manifesting after being used, and fully manifests after its original casting time would have been completed.

For instance, an imbibed resurrection potion activates after 1 hour (if the target still qualifies, due to a 1 hour casting time), while a conjure undead spell activates over 1 minute (regarding most conjured creatures). Potion miscibility applies normally if drinking a potion while another is in the process of manifestation.
___
**Concentration Spells.** Spells that normally require concentration by the caster instead require them by the imbiber, up to maximum duration.

Concentration (partial) spells and channeled spells cannot be made into potions, but sigil spells can be, in which case they are rolled normally (as sigil rolls).

#### Potion Forms
Potions take different forms, such as bombs, medicine pills, lotions, spray bottles, sticks, or amulet-like icons that crumble to release their essence.

In all such circumstances, they act the same as potions so long as they weigh similarly, can be applied by the same action, and used at touch or thrown range as described above. Note that some abilities allow for quicker use of alchemical items.
___
**Creation.** See the Item Creation Complexity and Cost table under Skills. Potions are always Consumables. A potion’s complexity scales with its rarity, as below.

| Potion Rarity  | Complexity |
|:-:|:-:|
| Common | Very Simple |
| Uncommon | Simple |
| Rare | Moderate |
| Epic | Complex |
| Legendary | Highly Complex |
| Artifact | Highly Complex |
___
**Concentration Spells.** Spells that normally require concentration by the caster instead require them by the imbiber, up to maximum duration.
___
**Mixing Potions.** Potions used in conjunction with one another have unpredictable effects. In the Warcraft universe, the potion miscibility rule is applied. When mixing potions, drinking several in succession, or having multiple potions layered in one vial, consumption or delivery (such as attacking with a potion vial, syringe, or bubble) counts as one potion. Roll for miscibility in this case.

The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results, counting the old mixture as the first potion, and the newer one as the second potion. The effects are not immediately obvious, subject to DM discretion (such as getting the result of a 1 with normally volatile potions, causing an explosion).
___
**Special.** Alchemy with Herbalism Kit

An Herbalism Kit counts as if Alchemist’s Supplies, but you may choose up to two alchemical formulae to learn. These still must be written down (and usually stored in a book or notes). You are not counted as if proficient when

it comes to other alchemical formulae and using potions for the purposes of potion DCs. You may not create potions higher than uncommon quality with an Herbalism Kit.

\pagebreakNum

<div class="classTable wide">

#### Potion Miscibility Chart
A potion undergoes miscibility when it mixes with another potion. This can occur when a creature drinks more than one potion in the span of 1 hour, mixes two potions in one vial (so they can be consumed by one action), or when they are a creature benefitting from one potion also benefits from a new one. You are not instantly aware of the results of the miscibility until it fully manifests.

| <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>d100<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> | Result |
|:-:|:-|
| 1-5 | **Explosion.** The mixed potions cause an instantaneous alchemical explosion which deals 5d10 arcane damage to the target or imbiber, and 1d10 arcane damage 5 ft. away from the target or imbiber. The newer potion does not have an effect |
| 6-10 | **Toxicity.** The mixed potion becomes a poison of DM's choice, and no longer provides benefit. |
| 11-15 | **Minor Toxicity.** One potion works, the other becomes a poison of the DM's choice (target  has advantage to saves). |
| 16-25 | **Cancellation.** Both potions in the mixture lose effect. |  
| 26-35 | **Minor Sync.** Both potions in the mixture work, but their benefit and durations are halved; if can't be halved, has no effect. |
| 36-40 | **Minor Cancellation.** Only one potion works normally. |  
| 41-70 | **Proper Sync.** Both potions in the mixture work normally. |
| 71-80 | **Birth from Chaos.** Both potions work normally, and the mixture also conjures a single random aberration, elemental, ooze, or homunculi (DM’s choice) rising from the potion (or puddle). The creature has a CR equal to the average spell level of both potions (or of the appropriate quality relative to rarity). It is allied to the imbiber, and disintegrates when reduced to 0 hit points. If one of the two potions was of a cantrip, it conjures a creature of CR ¼. This creature can be bound by the imbiber. |
| 81-90 | **Greater Sync.** Both potions in the mixture work, and have their numerical benefit and  maximum duration doubled; if they can't be doubled, the potion can be reused if salvaged with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check with Alchemist’s Supplies as an action. |
| 95-99 | **Superior Sync.** Both potions work, and the target can benefit from a third random potion of DM's choice. |
| 100 | **Augment.** One potion works and its duration becomes permanent. If the effect was instantaneous, such as a healing potion, this may cause an increase in maximum hit points, with the reverse happening if it dealt damage. At the DM’s discretion, this effect may be dispelled as an active spell effect or be suppressed with a potion which deals an opposite effect. A cantrip cannot gain this miscibility result, and instead reverts to Greater Sync. |

</div>

#### Special Crafting: Cauldrons
When choosing to brew or craft a potion, you may choose to instead brew them in larger batches than individual potion doses. This does not risk miscibility, as the potions are not in full form when being brewed.

By doing so, you need a container of reasonable size and appropriate material to brew the potions in. This is not included in Alchemists’ Supplies.

A cauldron (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) can hold up to 20 gallons, or enough materials for 5 potions (including the base liquid).

When creating a batch, you pay the resources for the number of potions you desire to craft. The crafting time is one-half the aggregate crafting time potions would normally require (considering their numbers).

For example, a priest proficient in Alchemy attempts to bless a basin filled with water to become holy water (common rarity), which is enough for 5 doses. He spends materials equal to 5 times the cost of crafting a single vial of holy water (or 50 gp in powdered silver and herbs), and it takes him 20 minutes (instead of 50 minutes) of prayer and inflection. If succeeding on the check by 14 points, the priest crafts it within 10 minutes (as described under normal

crafting).
___
**Experimentation.** You can experiment with potions in your batch. If you choose to do so, you gain half the yield (round down) of the potions you crafted. In return, you may roll an additional time for miscibility for each potion, and choose the better result.

Special cauldrons and mixing ladles (see Infusion) provide a benefit for crafting in batches.

#### Special Crafting: Transmuting Materials
Alchemist’s Supplies (in conjunction with the power of spells or the Alchemy feature) can be used to transmute materials from one type to another, which requires the transmute material spell.

Transmuting a mineral requires the original mineral and changes the original material into the target material, effectively going around usual material requirements (but altering size as appropriate). For instance, one can transmute alchemy materials from being fire-based to being water-based (allowing crafting different potions), or change 500 gp worth of iron into 500 gp worth of silver (turning a mound of iron into a silver rock).

\pagebreakNum

### Engineer’s Tools
Having proficiency in Engineer’s Tool allows you to craft technological devices. Such devices are non-magical items that are classified into one of four device types, according to general use and design: bombs, firearms, gadgets, and constructs.

Devices have rarity similar to infused items, which affect its initial traits, powers, malfunction rate (or chance for the device to not function as intended), and cost. A device’s engineering rarity is independent from its infusion rarity (therefore, you can infuse a boomstick, which is a common-quality device with an uncommon-quality +1 infusion to be a +1 boomstick).

#### Crafting Devices
Crafting a device costs the resources listed in the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table (modified per type; such as x10 the price for a use-item like a firearm, or x25 for a creature). This can be paid in crafting materials that are harvested or in gold pieces (or other coin) in a settlement that can reasonably have the required materials.
___
**Creation.** Creating a new technological device has a couple of steps one must follow.

##### Determine Rarity
When you choose to create a new device, you must first determine the starting Rarity. This affects the base abilities of the device, such as damage dealt, firearm capacity, maximum spell level replicated, and malfunction rate. You must start from a rarity you can access by your Proficiency Bonus. For example, a medium firearm that Rare in rarity deals 4d6 points of damage on a successful attack, has the capacity of 4 bullets, and a malfunction rate of 1-3. It requires a minimum Proficiency Bonus of 3 (and is thus EP 3).

##### Apply Modifications (optional)
Technological modifications affect the base abilities of devices, modifying the end rarity. There are many modifications, from the simple Reliable Device (lowers malfunction rating) to the more sophisticated Special Effect (which applies an additional spell effect on the target of the device). Each technological device class has its own modifications.

For instance, applying the Reliable Device modification to the above firearm lowers its malfunction rate by 2 points, but increases its rarity by 1 step. This can be counterbalanced with the Capacity modification, reducing rarity by 1 step and Capacity by 2 points.

If modified as such, the firearm remains Rare (or EP 3), deals 4d6 points of piercing damage on a hit, has the capacity of 2 bullets, and a malfunction rate of 1.

##### Determine End Rarity
After applying modifications, determine the end rarity, which will affect the final abilities of the device. See the Item Creation Complexity and Cost table under Skills for prices relative to rarity.

In the above example, the end rarity of the device was unchanged (Rare). The firearm has less space for ammunition in the magazine (or could possibly be a double-barreled rifle), but is more reliable.
___
**Malfunction Rate (MR).** Devices can malfunction when used, with the chances of malfunctioning increasing with the complexity of the device. The malfunction rate (MR) is range from 1 (5%) to the invested EP or Rarity rank of the device (5% per point, minimum 10% for Common devices), and represents the chance for the device to malfunction when used.  Whenever you use a technological device, you must roll for a malfunction, which can determine if it works successfully (or if it suffers a mishap if it is already malfunctioning).

| Rarity | MR (d20) | MR (%) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Common | 1-2 | 10% |
| Uncommon | 1-2 | 10% |
| Rare | 1-3 | 15% |
| Epic | 1-4 | 20% |
| Legendary	| 1-5 | 25% |
| Artifact | 1-6 | 30% |

You may roll a percentile roll or a d20 to check for malfunction (choose one), and if your device already has an attack roll (such as a gadget with a spell attack roll or a firearm), then your attack roll is also your malfunction check.

If you can roll multiple times (such as making multiple attacks or rolling with advantage or disadvantage), only the first roll is a test for malfunction. At any case, you roll only one malfunction check per round.

Dedicated tinkers can lower their malfunction rates by certain modifications and by class features (such as by the Knack for It ability). When a device first malfunctions, it does not work as intended. If a malfunctioning device malfunctions again, however, it suffers a mishap instead (See Appendix A for details on malfunctions and mishaps).
___
**Device save DC** = 8 + the designer’s Proficiency Bonus +

the designer’s Intelligence modifier
<br>
**Device Save DC (Generic)** = 10 + your Proficiency bonus

(if proficient)
___
Generic devices (such as store-bought) treat their creator’s Intelligence modifier as +2. If you are using a firearm or explosive and you don’t have proficiency, do not add your Proficiency Bonus.

##### Using Technological Devices
Devices can be used automatically if one knows how to use them (point and shoot, press a button, etc.) as an action, unless the device describes otherwise. Using a bomb or firearm is treated like using weapons of the same type, and are martial weapons.

Any creature proficient with martial weapons can also become proficient with firearms or explosives after one week of training. Not having proficiency with explosives also reduces the Device save DC (see above).

\pagebreakNum

| Device | Complexity | Cost |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Constructs | Very Complex | As CR (see Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table) |
| Explosives | Simple | As a consumable of the same rarity |
| Firearm | Moderate | As an item of the same rarity |
| Gadget | Varies* | As spells (see Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table) |
___
<div>* See Gadgets below.</div>

**Charges and Fuel.** A device’s Charge determines how many fuel units it takes for a single activation (a use for a gadget, attack with a firearm or explosive, or 1 hour of activation for a construct or engine). Charges depend on energy sources. By default, the energy source is mechanical (clockwork, springs, etc.). See Energy Sources below for reference.

**Technological Modifications.** Technological modifications can further customize technological devices. They cannot be used to access a higher-level spell or a higher-CR creature than what is limited by the creator’s level or Proficiency Bonus. If reducing the EP value of an explosive or firearm when it is Common, it instead removes 2 dice of damage (dealing 1d6 at Common quality).

**Temporary Add-ons.** In some cases, a device might not need a permanent modification, and can serve as an independent add-on. Barrel adjustment can increase a firearm’s range, for example, and a portable silencer can reduce noise when on a stealth mission. Some modifications cannot be made into add-ons.

An add-on alters a device without altering the device’s total engineering points (EP) or rarity. Installing an add-on takes 3 actions. If you are proficient with Engineer’s Tools, it costs only 1 action instead.

You can have one add-on at a device at a given time, and it costs equal to gadget of Common rarity. When a device malfunctions, the add-on suffers the condition as well automatically.

For instance, the sniper gun has a pre-built silencer modification. Instead of the modification (which can reduce the total damage, capacity, or other base feature), the sniper rifle can benefit from a silencer add-on, if you are willing to run the problem of paying for the malfunction of two devices instead of one.

#### Creatures (Constructs)
**Examples. Golems, Robots, Mecha and Vehicles**
___
**Using Constructs.** Creatures created by engineering are overwhelmingly constructs. For this purpose, all mention of creatures will refer to constructs instead. Constructs require an Action (Use Object) to activate or deactivate. Once activated, the construct takes 1 minute to begin acting. A construct can be activated faster if modified (such as via a technological modification). If programmed to activate on an uncommon trigger (such as an intrusion or being hit), activation takes only one round instead.

Constructs act like creatures of the construct type. They obey those who hold control over them (or who drive them, if mecha and vehicles). Constructs have the capacity for ten charges (1 hour of activation per charge), consuming fuel units appropriate to the construct’s size and rarity per hour (see Fuel and Energy sources below). A construct’s properties and charges also depend on its energy source.

The construct may have a Challenge of equal to the value in the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table, and may be custom-built from any construct in the Monster Guide.
Technological Modifications can modify the rarity for additional customization as well (such as water-proofing, adding movement types, or increased reliability).

##### Construct Behavior
Constructs take orders when the user communicates it to them via touching and/or manipulating knobs/controls on them, or otherwise issuing a spoken command when adjacent to them. Constructs may be programmed to behave independently, or when controlled by the user (in the latter case, it is treated as a mount). In the case of independent behavior, commanding the construct requires knowing how the device was programmed (activation codes, hidden command word, etc.) to control it. A construct that is under a character’s control can be deactivated as described above.

The DC of any ability used by a construct is equal to 8 + the crafter’s proficiency bonus + the crafter’s Intelligence modifier (instead of being based off the construct’s Proficiency and ability scores).

##### Constructs and Drivers
Constructs and vehicles may require drivers when controlled from within. It takes a Bonus Action and 5 ft. of movement to enter or leave a construct (besides the Action to start and the warming up time). A driver can control a construct or vehicle directly instead of their own character. When the user performs an Action or moves from within the construct, the Action is performed instead by the construct instead (using the construct’s Proficiency Bonus, Strength score, movement speed, and abilities) instead of that of the pilot’s own, except with ranged attacks, spellcasting, and skill checks (which use the driver’s bonuses, if they wish).
For example, a Dwarven siege engine driver can use his action to either shoot the siege engine’s cannons or peer out of the siege engine and shoot their personal rifle (leaving the siege engine without an Action).

##### Mecha
A construct that can be entered is usually called a mecha. The mecha cannot be smaller than its user. If the construct is equal in size to the driver, it is called a suit, but otherwise follows the same rules.

A user within a mecha or suit gains ¾ cover versus any attack from outside, but takes 1/4 the damage suffered by the mecha. If the damage cannot harm the mecha and bypasses it (such as psychic damage), it deals full damage to the user if the effect has line of sight and effect.
The user does not benefit from any damage or condition resistances or immunities the mecha has, and may be targeted (though the user still benefits from 3/4 cover).

##### Vehicles
Some siege weapons can’t normally move (and are designated by Push), and others require charges as mecha. Vehicles may deal siege damage or normal damage (declared during creation). Siege damage falls under normal categories of nonmagical slashing/bludgeoning, etc., but if designated as siege attacks, it deals double damage to structures, and half to creatures.

\pagebreakNum

##### Non-Construct Vehicles and Engines
A vehicle with no inborn engineering mechanisms that warrant a challenge rating, such as ships or carts, are not considered constructs, but are considered objects instead. These may use the Vehicle Engine device (see below under Vehicles).

##### Healing Constructs
Restoring hit points to a construct device is a task of moderate complexity, and restores 1d8 hit points + the character’s Intelligence or Agility modifier. Each instance of fixing a construct consumes 10 gp of engineering materials.

##### Mounted Weapons on Constructs
Constructs can be used to mount defensive gadgets, rockets, firearms, and other weapons. These modifications are external (and thus can be stolen, targeted, or sabotaged). The user (or any fellow riders) may make use of these resources as if the item is within reach so long as they are within the construct (such as mounting firearms for an ally to use). A construct can hold heavier weapons (one step above Heavy for each size), but must be immobilized (see Firearms).

Firearms and gadgets on a vehicle or mech still require actions to reload, but if the vehicle has other occupants, they may instead use their actions to reload instead, leaving the shooter free to use the firearm constantly the next round.

If the driver is concentrating on a gadget with a Duration of Concentration, the construct can perform the concentration instead so long as the driver is within the device.

<div class="classTable wide">

##### Construct Modifications
**Coated Interior (1 EP).** When activating a construct and being seated inside it (such as a mech or vehicle), the pilot gains 1d10 + 3 temporary hit points. This applies only to attacks that stem from outside the mech, and does not apply to arcane, holy, fel, shadow, or psychic damage. For each points of CR of the construct above 1, the bonus increases by another 5 temporary hit points. Once the pilot gains this bonus, he cannot gain it again until completing a short rest.
___
**Efficient Fuel (1 EP).** The construct consumes one-quarter less fuel units than is normally required for a single charge.
___
**Quick Startup (1 EP).** The construct takes one round to activate. If the construct is activated on condition or contingency, it activates instantly instead (and is quick enough to allow it to use its reaction).
___
**Golem (+0, special)** This modification changes the construct to no longer require fuel for its engine of choice, but obeys controller near-magically. The golem is immune to any spell or Effect that would alter its form. When finished, the golem is fully inert unless it is also infused (as per the infusion skill), with a matrix of one step less rarity (and cost) to the golem's own rarity). If the rarity is Common, the cost is half that of an infusion of the same rarity.
___
**Reliable Device (1 EP).** The device’s function is controlled. Its malfunction rating is reduced by 2 points for each EP invested. This modification also does not increase the malfunction rating.
___
**Special Movement (1 EP).** You modify the construct to swim, climb, or fly (choose one per modification, minimum rarity of Epic for flight). See below the speeds granted.

| Proficiency | Speed (choose one speed type) |
|:-:|:-:|
| +2 | - |
| +3 | 15 |
| +4 | 30 (Fly 15) |
| +5 | 60 (fly 30) |
| +6 | 90 (fly 60) |
___
The engineer may reduce the existing land speed by 5 feet to add it to special movement, up to a minimum land speed of 0 feet. Fly requires a minimum rarity of Epic if it was not a base feature of the construct. |

</div>

*Note.* Constructs have their own air supply if designed for air or underwater (or if specified so). This increases the cost of crafting by 10%, but allows enough breathable air 4 hours for a number of creatures equal to the construct’s size (double capacity per size modifier).

For example, a Large submarine can hold enough air to allow a Large creature 4 hours of breath. If hosting a medium creature, it holds enough air for two medium creatures. If driven by one creature, it remains for 8 hours instead.

\pagebreakNum

#### Explosives
**Examples. The Big One, hand grenades, goblin land mines, siege rockets, siege breaching charge**
___
**Using Explosives.** Explosives can be used as an attack action, with the effect reliant on the form the explosive takes. An explosive can be thrown as a ranged weapon (if a bomb or rocket, see below) as a weapon attack, or target an area without a specific target. They affect a 10-ft.-radius sphere, and call for an Agility saving throw to halve the damage dealt. An explosive weighs 1 lbs. per EP invested (2 lb. for Common, 6 lb. for Artifact, etc.)
___
**Bomb (or grenade).** Bombs are thrown as light thrown weapons with a range of 30/60 feet. They deal no damage on impact, but explode when their fuse determines it (at the end of the user’s turn, usually, see fuses below). A bomb that is thrown beyond optimal range provides advantage to saving throws to half damage. If you target a creature with the bomb as a ranged weapon attack and succeed on the attack roll, they do not get to roll to halve damage, and suffer the full damage. The creatures in the blast radius are still entitled saving throws as normal. If throwing a bomb on a target, the attack roll is the malfunction roll test, otherwise you must roll for malfunction as a separate d20 roll.
___
**Mine.** Mines are explosive traps that explode when stepped on (unless modified with a fuse). A mine can be detected with a successful Spirit (Perception) check and disarmed with a successful Agility (Thieves’ Tools) check against the Device save DC, and is treated as a trap. The mine must pass a successful malfunction roll test.
___
**Rocket.** Rockets are light ranged projectile weapons with a range of 60/120 feet that soar to the point of impact and then explode instantaneously. They deal no damage on impact, but explode when their fuse determines it (or upon impact, whichever applies). If modified with a fuse, the rocket instead embeds itself in the targeted area and explodes when the fuse determines it. A rocket that is launched beyond optimal range provides advantage to saving throws to half damage. If you target a creature with the rocket and succeed on the attack roll, they do not get to roll to halve damage, and suffer the full damage. The creatures in the blast radius are still entitled saving throws as normal.

When a rocket reaches its maximum range, it explodes regardless of whether it reached its target or not. If it misses its target, however, it continues along the path without guidance, usually exploding at some other point (such as at the maximum range or upon impact with a wall). If launching a rocket on a target, the attack roll is the malfunction roll test, otherwise you must roll for malfunction as a separate d20 roll.

If an explosive of any type explodes near another one, they both set off, and the damage stacks (up to triple the highest amount of damage dice, and tripling the average area of effect, to no limit in area).

Explosives deal dice in damage depending on their base Engineering Point investment (based on rarity), see the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table.

If you do not suffer disadvantage to range attacks from long distance, you do not suffer penalty for throwing bombs and rockets (such as by the sharpshooter feat, or by negating disadvantage to attack by having advantage or another feature).
___
**Explosives and Ammunition.** Ammunition such as arrows, crossbow bolts, or even bullets can be modified for explosives. This can represent anything from firearm explosive shells to a primitive attempt to tie a rocket to an arrow with a loose bit of string. When using ammunition explosives, your ranged attack roll is resolved with disadvantage on the attack due to the ammunition’s weight. If you treat this as a strike effect and spend a bonus action, you can ignore the disadvantage on attacks.

If the attack with the ammunition effect is a direct attack (attack roll), the explosion takes place on the target’s space (follow the rules for fuses if they apply). If the attack has a saving throw, the primary target is not entitled a saving throw against the explosion radius (unlike the creatures in its area of effect).

A piece of ammunition that has an explosive is treated as infused ammunition (see infused ammunition in Chapter 5), and cannot be infused.

If an ammunition explosive misses, draw a line from yourself to the target. If the line stops at a creature that is one size category larger than the target (minimum Large) or cover (such as a wall or tree), the attack is resolved as if it hit. If the target is a creature, compare the attack roll versus the creature’s AC, otherwise it continues until it reaches the end of the maximum range of the weapon, and explodes at that point.
___
**Plant Explosives.** Besides thrown, set, or launched, an explosive can be planted on targets with an Agility (Sleight of Hand) check contested to Spirit (Perception). The Sleight of Hand check is made with disadvantage if the fuse is instantaneous.
If the planting goes unnoticed, the target suffers disadvantage to their saving throw against the explosive when it detonates.
___
**Explosives Size.** Explosives can be increased in size (to become equivalent to creature-sized). Assume normal explosives are Tiny-sized, and calculate each step to increase the damage dice as follows.
___
**Dice Progression**
| | | | | | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| d6 | d8 | d10  |2d6  |3d6  | 4d6 (and so on) |
| Medium | Large | Huge | Gargantuan | - | - |

Tiny explosives include hand grenades, rockets, or normal mines. Small explosives include rocket stands, large mines. Medium explosives include explosive totems, a mounted rocket, or an anti-vehicle mine.

If increased in size, all rolls to use bombs and rockets have disadvantage if the one using them does not use a specialized device (such as a rocket stand, mortar, or mine-launcher). Anything larger than the first size increase (or Bomb+/Mine+/Rocket+) must be deployed through other means (such as being planted into walls, thrown by catapults, used by an equal-sized construct, dropped off zeppelins, or by a dedicated vehicle to serve as a rocket-stand).

Increasing size also multiplies the final crafting cost and weight by 2 per size category (x2 if Small, x3 if Medium, etc.).

Furthermore, each size category increase also applies the Widened Explosion modification for no cost.
___
**Explosive Fuses.** Depending on the fuse of an explosive, they can explode on various times from being triggered (usually at the end of its user’s turn).

\pagebreakNum

**Instantaneous fuse.** The explosive explodes at the end of its user’s turn.
___
**Delayed fuse.** The explosive explodes after 1d4 rounds, starting at the end of the user’s turn.
___
**Long fuse.** The explosive explodes after one minute.
___
A character may also make fuses that are predesigned to explode after a specific number of rounds (determined at the time of crafting). Changing a fuse costs a bonus action and access to Engineer’s Tools.

Fuses can modify explosives in other forms as well as in bomb form, such as a mine exploding a few minutes after being stepped over (that would collapse a cave’s mouth after a minute of an intruder enters), or a rocket head that would scatter defenders, only to explode after they return to manning their posts (secure in the belief that the rocket malfunctioned).

<div class="classTable wide">

##### Explosive Modifications
**Careful Explosion (1 EP).** The explosive’s (any type) damage can be controlled. It can exclude a number of 5-foot squares equal to double the EP invested + your intelligence modifier, and can be designated by the user when the bomb explodes.
___
**Earth (1 or 0 EP, rockets only).** The rocket is outfitted with fast-moving drills, and can be launched to drill into the earth and explode under the target. If you have a remote keyed to the rocket, you can direct it to attack a target. If the target is standing on the ground, you have a +2 bonus to attack rolls to attack the target. If the target is aware and uses a reaction to jump, the bonus is negated (and the attack is made normally). This can cost no modification instead, and only work in the earth.
___
**Firework (1 EP).** The explosive (any type) releases a sharp whistle and a ringing blast. A creature who fails their saving throw against this explosive must also roll a Stamina saving throw. Upon a failed save, roll 1d4 to see the effect.

| Roll | Result |
| 1 | Target is blinded for 1 minute |
| 2	| Target is deafened for 1 minute |
| 3	| Target is blinded and deafened for 3 rounds |
| 4	| Target loses their reaction for until the end of your turn in the next round |
___
**Focused (-1 EP).** The explosive (any type) explosive radius halves per engineering point applied to the modification (5-foot square for explosives not modified by size). This modification is applied after all increases.
___
**Reliable Device (1 EP).** The device’s function is controlled. Its malfunction rating is reduced by 2 points for each EP invested. This can be applied in reverse, creating a more unreliable device (to benefit more from Superfunction).
___
**Sapper (0 EP).** The explosive (any type) deals double damage to structures, but half to creatures (constructs are creatures for this purpose).
___
**Solid Coating (1 EP).** The explosive has a solid coating. If a rocket or bomb, the explosive deals 1d8 extra bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage on impact. This is added to the explosive’s own damage, but only when targeting a creature’s AC (see Using Explosives above). This damage scales with the size of the device (as appropriate). Furthermore, the explosive does not explode prematurely from being damaged or mishandled, and only explodes as a result of malfunction, contact (if in mine form), sabotage, reaching maximum distance (if in rocket form), being launched (such as from a siege weapon cannon), or activation by the fuse (whichever applies).
___
**Special Effect (special).** The explosive (any type) may manifest a cantrip (or a spell of level equal to half the engineering points spent, round down). The cantrip is treated as if the caster is of a level equal to double the EP invested. If it is a direct effect, it targets creatures on the 5-foot space the bomb was tossed only, or the cantrip’s normal area and targets (whichever is less). If this is an area of effect, it takes place in its original spell area or in the area of effect of the bomb (whichever is smaller). The target may attempt a saving throw against the Device save DC to negate the effects (unless the spell already called for a saving throw).
___
**Water (1 or 0 EP).** The explosive is waterproofed, and can be used both underwater and in air-less environments regardless of fuel type. This can cost no modification instead, and only work underwater.
___
**Weakened (-1 EP).** The device deals 1 less dice of damage. This is applied before accounting for size changes to damage dice.
___
**Widened Explosion (1 EP).** The explosive (any type) explosive radius doubles. This can be applied multiple times.

</div>

Note. Explosives cannot have add-ons.

\pagebreakNum

#### Firearms
**Examples. Heavy and medium rifles, boomstick, siege cannons, sniper rifles.**
Using Firearms. Firearms are ranged ammunition weapons. They come in light, medium, and heavy varieties.

The more complex firearms are, the more damage they inflict, dealing a number of damage dice depending on their base rarity (see the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table). The damage dice and range of the weapon depend on the firearm’s size:
___
**Light.** d4 damage/dice, range 100/400 ft., and the firearm has the light and finesse properties, and weighs 5 lbs.
___
**Medium.** d6 damage/dice, range 150/600, and the firearm weighs 10 lbs.
___
**Heavy.** d8 damage/dice, range 200/800. The firearm has the heavy and two-handed properties, and weighs 15 lbs.
___
By default, bullets deal piercing damage, but the ammunition type can allow a firearm to deal other types (as described under Chapter 5). Attaching a bayonet to a firearm allows you to make melee attacks with it. Attacking with a firearm without a bayonet allows you to deal only its base damage with an attack roll (1d8 with a heavy firearm), but you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack.

##### Firearm Capacity
Despite requiring ammunition, firearms do not have the loading or ammunition weapon properties. Firearms (and specially modified crossbows) instead have the capacity weapon property. Capacity determines the number of attacks the firearm or crossbow can make before you must use an Action to reload. A firearm has capacity equal to 1 bullet per rarity grade (2 at Common rarity). Certain technological modifications can vastly influence bullet capacity (+3 or -3 per step), allowing for more (or less) attacks before you must reload. Some features use multiple bullets when used (such as scattershot or automatic shot), requiring a good capacity.

As a technological device, firearms also require fuel per shot. When using gunpowder, firearms are very efficient, costing only 2 ounces (1/8th a pound) for a single shot, regardless of rarity.

For example, a Common medium firearm deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful attack, and has a capacity of 2 bullets; while a Legendary light firearm deals 6d4 instead and has a capacity of 5 instead.

##### Crossbows
Crossbows are similar to firearms in potential. Normal crossbows do not count as technological devices, however, unless they are modified by one with proficiency in Engineer’s Tools.

Despite crossbows allowing only a single attack and using mechanical (clockwork) engines, they can be modified from their base rarity. Their base statistics are below (starting with 1 dice of damage).
___
**Light (originally Hand Crossbow).** 1d6 damage, range 30/120 ft., and the crossbow has the light and loading properties, costs 75 gp, and weighs 3 lbs.
___
**Medium (originally Light Crossbow).** 1d8 damage, range 80/320 ft., and the crossbow has the loading and two-hand properties, costs 25 gp, and weighs 5 lbs.
___
**Heavy (originally Heavy Crossbow).** 1d10 damage, range 100/400 ft., and the crossbow has the heavy, loading, and two-handed properties, costs 50 gp, and weighs 18 lbs.
___
By modifying crossbows, you can alter the number of damage dice the crossbow deals, its capacity (such as by adding a reload function), range, and other technological modifications. Choosing to do so, however, alters the crossbow too far from the original (efficient) designs, changing the components so much that you must treat them as technological devices in terms of cost as well.

Crossbows start with 1 capacity (1 bolt) and 1 dice of damage at Common rarity (or 1 dice and 1 capacity below firearms).

If upgraded, crossbows gain the following traits:

They lose the Loading property, and gain the mechanical (clockwork) engine. Instead of the normal requirements to load a mechanical engine, a crossbow requires an action to reload. If you have the Crossbow Expert feat, you can reload as a Bonus Action. Otherwise, treat crossbows as firearms for the purposes of reloading.

The crossbow deals damage 1 dice less than firearms of the same rarity. For example, where a Legendary heavy firearm deals 6d8 damage, a Legendary heavy crossbow deals 5d10 instead.

The crossbow gains 1 less Capacity than firearms of the same rarity, and can be modified with the Capacity modification (adding 2 extra bolt capacity per step).

They gain the chance to malfunction. The malfunction rate is 1 point less than firearms of the same rarity (minimum 1).

Crossbows retain their common ammunition type, silence, and capability for underwater use.

##### Special Attack: Touch-Blast Strike
When making a melee attack with a firearm ready (such as fighting with a saber and then shooting, or stabbing with a bayonet and then firing), you may declare a touch-blast strike. In this case, you may use a bonus action to shoot the firearm, and you do not take disadvantage from shooting in melee. If the melee attack already successfully hit the target, the firearm attack is furthermore made with advantage. This is a special strike effect.

##### Firearm/Crossbow Sizes
Firearms and crossbows can be increased in size from being useable by Medium creatures (to become equivalent to creature-sized or larger). This increases the damage and range of such weapons, at the expense of cost, reload/capacity, and weight.
___
**Damage**
Assume normal weapons are Tiny-sized, and calculate each step to increase the damage dice as follows.
___
**Dice Progression**
| | | | | | | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | 2d6 | 3d6 | +d6/step |
___
**Range**
The range of firearms increases by 50/200 feet per step.
___
**Capacity.** The capacity of firearms is reduced by 1 per step (minimum 1) starting from Heavy. If modified with the scattershot or automatic fire modifications, it always has enough ammunition to make a single attack before requiring reload. For each missing capacity point, however, it requires another action to reload.

\pagebreakNum

___
**Cost.** Increasing the size multiplies the crafting cost by 2 per step starting from Heavy.
___
**Reload/Capacity.** For each step above Heavy, the device requires two additional actions to reload. If you can use a bonus action to reload (such as a being a sufficiently-trained gunner Tinker), you may use your action and bonus action to reload at an accelerated rate.
___
**Weight.** Increasing the size multiplies the firearm’s weight by 6 per step (starting at 15 lbs. for heavy, 90 lbs. for Heavy+, 540 lbs. for Heavy++, 3,240 lbs. for Heavy+++, etc.). All rolls to attack with Heavy+ (and heavier) firearms and crossbows have disadvantage if the one making the roll does not use a stand (such as nailing it down or having it mounted).

If mounted on a vehicle or creature (such as a steam tank, mech, or simple wheels), the vehicle must be grounded. Grounding a mount requires its full movement (reducing its movement to 0), and makes its movement 0 for until the start of the user’s turn in the next round (on which the user can move normally).
___
For example, the Common medium boomstick has the following statistics:
* 2d6 damage, 10 lbs., 2 capacity, range 150/600 feet

___
It can be improved one step to heavy, changing as follows:
* 2d8 damage, 15 lbs., 2 capacity, range 200/800 feet
___
Increasing its size two further steps increases its creature-equivalent size from Tiny-equivalent to Medium (or Heavy++). A human or orc-sized firearm would likely be considered to be a 6-pounder cannon, and would have the following statistics:
* 4d6 damage, 540 lbs., 1 capacity, range 400/1,600 feet
___
The 6 pounder cannon requires 3 actions to reload instead of one, and costs 3 times as much as a normal heavy firearm.

<div class="classTable wide">

##### Firearm Modifications
**Automatic Fire (1 EP).** The firearm deals area damage in a line instead of a direct attack. This is treated as an area attack in a 5-foot wide line with length equal to half the firearm’s initial range. Creatures in the area can attempt an Agility saving throw against the Device save DC to halve the damage. When used this way, not having proficiency reduces the Device save DC. The firearm uses three pieces of ammunition when making an attack. You can make a normal or area attack with a firearm, but not both, in a given round.
___
**Capacity (+/- 1 EP).** The firearm alters its current ammo capacity by 3 points per EP modified. This can be made into an add-on (as a clip or magazine).
___
**Blaster (+0 EP).** The firearm’s range is quartered, but whenever it successfully hits an enemy, you may choose one of two special effects:
* You may deal one additional dice of damage of the firearm’s type.
* You may push the target up to 5 feet per Rarity of the firearm (up to a maximum of 30 feet away from you).
___
*Special.* If applied to a weapon that has the automatic fire or scattershot modifications, the firearm’s range is not reduced, but the extra effect only applies to the area attacks, and only then if the target is within half the initial range (instead of reducing the current range).
___
**Extended Reload (-1 EP).** This device has a less efficient reload mechanism. This requires 1 extra action to reload. This can be made into an add-on, but only to reduce the final rarity of another modification.
___
**Reliable Device (1 EP).** The device’s function is controlled. Its malfunction rating is reduced by 2 points for each EP invested (minimum 0). This modification also does not increase the malfunction rating for modified EP, and thus lowers the chance of a Superfunction as well.
___
**Scattershot (1 EP).** The firearm can deal damage in a cone instead of a direct attack. This is treated as an area attack in a cone with a length of one-tenth the firearm’s initial range. Creatures in the area can attempt an Agility saving throw against the Device save DC to halve the damage. The firearm uses two pieces of ammunition when making an attack. You can make a normal or area attack with a firearm, but not both, in a given round.
___
**Silenced (1 EP).** The firearm’s sound is muffled, and imposes no penalty to the user’s Stealth check when used. This can be made into an add-on.
___
**Sniper (1 EP).** The firearm’s range doubles. This can be made into an add-on.
___
**Shortened (-1 EP).** The firearm’s range is halved. This can be made into an add-on, but only to reduce the final rarity of another modification.
___
**Water (1 EP).** The firearm is waterproofed, and can function in water normally as well as in air-less environments regardless of engine. This reduces the firearm’s range by quarter, however. This can be made into an add-on.
___
**Weakened (-1 EP).** The device deals 1 less base dice of damage. This is applied before accounting for size changes to damage dice.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

A firearm can also be modified with a bayonet (see Chapter 5). Some firearms come with special bayonet replacements, usually described in their entry.

##### Modified Ammunition
Ammunition can be modified as well. Modified ammunition includes buck shot (blaster), distance shot (sniper), chain shot (automatic fire), spread shots (scattershot modification), underwater shot (water modification), etc. Some modifications cannot be made into bullets, such as silenced (as the firearm is what makes the noise), subject to DM adjudication.

Modified ammunition costs as much as a consumable with an EP value of 1 per point; hence an underwater scatter shot costs as much as an EP 2 consumable. A malfunction when using modified ammunition counts as if the firearm malfunctioned.

\pagebreakNum

#### Gadgets
**Examples. Mind remote, rocket boots, pulley gun, rocket launcher, and atomizer**

##### Using Gadgets
These technological devices act like items that replicate spells. Using a gadget takes the same action it takes to cast the spell.

A gadget may replicate spell levels appropriate to its rarity (see the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table). The rarer the gadget, the higher level spells it can replicate (or the better modifications it has).

Casting a spell through a gadget is not counted as a real spell, and thus is not subject to effects dependent on magic type, schools, and can be used against creatures that are immune to or resistant to magic.

##### Crafting Complexity
Depending on rarity, the gadget has varying degrees of complexity in crafting.

| Gadget Rarity | Crafting Complexity |
|:-:|:-:|
| Common | Very Simple |
| Uncommon | Simple |
| Rare | Moderate |
| Epic | Complex |
| Legendary | Highly Complex |
| Artifact | Highly Complex |

##### Gadget Fuel
Gadgets consume fuel upon being used (see fuel and energy sources below) commensurate with its rarity.

Gadgets have the capacity for ten charges (1 use per charge), consuming fuel units appropriate to the gadget’s rarity per use (see Fuel and Energy sources below). When a device is too small to reasonably carry its fuel capacity (such as a light gadget that works with coal), you must attach the device to a fuel unit, which can be carried as a backpack).
___
**Fuel Charge of Gadgets** = 1 fuel unit (if Common) or 2 fuel units (per rarity above Common)
___
For instance, a Rare (+3) gadget (such as the Buzz Box) consumes 6 fuel units for a single charge (2 fuel x rarity of 3). Its maximum charge capacity is 60.

This is similar to the fuel consumption of constructs.

##### Gadget Cooldown
After being used, a gadget must cool down for 1 minute before it can be used again. Devices begin their cooldown from the end of the device’s duration.

If the gadget replicates spell levels from 4-6, the device’s cooldown is 8 hours instead of 1 minute.

If the gadget replicates spell levels from 7-9, the cooldown is 1 day instead of 8 hours. A gadgeteer can lessen these restrictions.

##### Concentration Spells
Gadgets that replicate spells with a Duration of Concentration must be manipulated constantly to keep the benefit (treat as if concentrating). It also requires the same check to maintain concentration. You must therefore be holding the device and focusing on continuing operation normally.

A device can be manipulated with a touch (does not require an action) to end its effect early (as if ceasing to concentrate).

If you are in a construct like a mech or a vehicle and the gadget is mounted to it, you may allow the construct to maintain concentration instead (allowing you to activate another gadget and concentrate on it instead). If either the construct or you are attacked, however, a concentration check is required for both devices.

##### Gadget Sizes
Gadgets come in three possible sizes; Light (useable one-handed, finesse, and weigh 5 lbs.), Medium (useable one-handed, 10 lbs.), and Heavy (useable two-handed, 15 lbs.).

By default, a gadget is Light in size (and is easily concealed), and is further modified by the spell it replicates and other variables.

##### Magic School
The following magic schools render the gadget one step heavier: Conjuration, Evocation, Necromancy, and Transmutation.

##### Modifications
The gadget can gain one modification worth 1 EP. If already Heavy, the weight of the gadget becomes 75 lbs., and cannot be used if you moved in the same round. Furthermore, using it reduces your speed when used to 0.

If the spell replicated by the gadget has a range or target of self or personal, or grants or affects movement speed (such as the fly, haste, or feather fall spells), the gadget must also be worn on a harness. A single harness can hold one gadget (which can be replaced with an Action). One cannot wear a harness and armor heavier than Light Armor at the same time, but an armor of that size (Light) can be modified to also be a harness.

If a spell is a touch spell that may also target other creatures, creating it as a harness increases the spell’s duration by 25% instead.

##### Special Gadgets: Trap Gadgets
Trap gadgets are priced as ‘consumable’ gadgets (despite the fact that they are not consumed on use). They trigger once the trap requirements are met (such as coming within 10 feet of them, touching the trap, triggering a remote gadget, or coming within sight if modified with the alarm gadget). A trap gadget triggers a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. The Spirit (Perception) DC to find the device, as well as the Agility (Thieves’ Tools) DC to disable the device is equal to the device’s DC.

If the spell used in the device has a DC, refer to the Device save DC below. If it has an attack, refer to the Device attack modifier instead.
___
**Device save DC** = 8 + the designer’s proficiency bonus +

the designer’s Intelligence modifier
___
**Device attack modifier** = 4 + the designer’s proficiency bonus +

the designer’s Intelligence modifier

\pagebreakNum

##### Special Gadgets: Strike Gadgets
Gadgets that replicate strike (including shot) effects consume less power. Each fuel charge for such devices costs only one-quarter the normal fuel units for a single use.

If the gadget is for a strike effect, the gadget also includes the weapon to which the gadget is linked. For instance, the swipe and shred spell formed into a gadget may be linked to a shortsword (creating a buzz saw), or a greataxe (creating a chainsaw axe). A hit with the strike gadget can activate the swipe and shred spell as a strike effect (and bonus action).

With such a device, you may make four attacks for a single charge the device’s rarity and size would normally require. A strike gadget adds +2 lb. to a weapon’s mass, and are sometimes called ‘cores’.

A strike gadget can be prepared to be a trap gadget. For instance, the strike gadget can be prepared as a trap to strike if a creature comes within 10 feet of the device.

<div class="classTable wide">

##### Gadget Modifications
**Focused Device (1 EP).** You have advantage to any check to maintain concentration on this gadget.
___
**Long Cooldown (-1 EP).** The gadget requires an hour to cool down instead of the normal duration. This cannot be used with quick use.
___
**Low Charge (-1 EP).** The gadget can contain only fuel enough for three Charges, not ten. If taken again, it has enough fuel for 1 charge only. If hooked up to a backup fuel tank, it instead consumes three times the normal units for a single charge.
___
**Quick Use (1 EP).** The gadget’s cooldown is 1d4 rounds instead of 1 minute. If applied twice, the gadget can be used again at the end of your turn in the next round. If applied to a device with a longer cooldown, it is reduced to 1 hour if it was 8 hours cooldown, and 8 hours if its cooldown was 1 day.
___
**Reliable Device (1 EP).** The device’s function is controlled. Its malfunction rating is reduced by 2 points for each EP invested. This modification also does not increase the malfunction rating.
___
**Small (1 EP).** The gadget is one size smaller (from medium to light, or heavy to medium), weighs appropriately, and its Malfunction Rate is reduced by 1 point. This does not affect fuel consumption, only mobility, carry capacity and ability to hide it.

</div>

#### Vehicles and Vehicle Engines
Vehicles that move without their own power (such as being pushed or dragged by muscle or wind) are not constructs at all, and are treated as normal vehicles in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Siege weapons that are not attached to constructs must also be driven this way.

Vehicle engines are special technological devices that repeatedly perform a simple task, such as turning gears, raising and lowering levers, and other tasks that an unskilled laborer can perform. They are often used as the driving force behind vehicles such as boats and airships, allowing them to move without relying on muscle (oars), or current (water or wind current) at their normal speed.
___
*Special.* An engine cannot be used to provide more mechanical fuel units than the fuel units that are spent on its operation.

Engines have rarity and size, which allow it to move vehicles that are not battle-construct or mech. For example, an engine can move a steamship or airship, but not a siege engine (which is a construct). Constructs and mechs consume fuel appropriate for size and rarity, like engines, but do not require crew members to man (unlike constructs, which require one driver for all tasks). An engine cannot cover more than 75% of the required crew members in a vehicle.

Engines have 1 less malfunction rating compared to other devices of the same rarity, and consume fuel on an hourly basis.

The complexity of an engine is equal to that of a gadget of the same rarity.

##### Engine Rarity and Size
Rarity affects the effective number of unskilled laborers or crew members the engine replaces, and size acts as a multiplier to the number of unskilled laborers. The engine consumes fuel appropriate to the rarity and size together.

| Rarity | Fuel per Hour | Unskilled laborers/Crew Members |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Common | 1/4 | 1 |
| Uncommon | 1 | 5 |
| Rare | 2 | 15 |
| Epic | 3 | 30 |
| Legendary | 4 | 90 |
| Artifact | 5 | 270 |
___
Engine sizes start at Medium size (x1), and increase in size category similar to creatures (x2 for total laborers at large), x3 at huge, etc.).

With each size category of the engine above Medium, the total number of unskilled laborers double (x2 for large, x3 for huge, x4 for gargantuan), and with it the fuel cost.

##### Engine Fuel
Engine fuel can also be used to activate gadgets on board of the vehicle (treat as a backup fuel tank). Devices that use the vehicle’s engine fuel increase their malfunction rating by 1 point if the engine types are different.

You may spend 1 EP (improving its rarity and cost) to specifically enhance an engine's fuel consumption, reducing its fuel by 75% per step (round down), like the efficient fuel gadget modification.

\pagebreakNum

For example, a Huge (x3) Uncommon (1 base fuel) engine provides 15 laborers (size category of 3 times the base laborers of 5), enough to cover 75% of the crew members for a zeppelin (crew 20). Such engine costs 3 pints of oil per hour (1 base; x3 modifier), or 3 vials of phlogiston every 5 hours. If Rare in quality, it would be more efficient, having the same total labor crew but use only 1 vials of oil per hour, or 1 vial of phlogiston per 5 hours.

A Large (x2) Rare (2 base fuel) can perform the work of 30 unskilled laborers, enough to cover 50% of the crew size of a juggernaut for 4 (2 base, x2 modifier) vials of phlogiston per hour (or 16 pounds of coal per hour). If increased to very rare for fuel consumption it consumes only 1 vial (or 4 pound of coal per hour).

Examples of vehicles (with engines) are in chapter 8 (Vehicles).

#### Fuel and Energy Sources
All devices require fuel at the start of their operation, or the beginning of an hour of activity (whichever applies). The device engine (see below) determines the type of fuel, and the cost of refueling. How much fuel units are consumed by a single fuel charge depends on two factors:
___
**Rarity.** Higher-rarity devices require more fuel.
___
**Size.** Larger devices require more fuel, but are usually stronger or more reliable.
___
**Fuel Charge** = 1 fuel unit (if Common) or 2 fuel units

(per rarity above Common) + 4 fuel units per size above

Medium (+0 at Medium)
___
For instance, a Common suit of Gnomish Combat Armor is Medium. It costs 1 fuel units per charge (1 due to Common rarity + 0 due to Medium size), while a Rare Huge Crowd Pummeler consumes 12 fuel units per charge (4 due to Rare rarity + 8 due to Huge size). Depending on the engine type, this might require clockwork, coal, mana, electricity, or even soul power.

Gadgets always act as if they are Medium sized (no size modifier).

##### Fuel scales as follows
For Common rarity, the device’s fuel charge is 1 fuel unit.

For every step of rarity above Common, the device’s fuel charge is 2 fuel units.

For every size above Medium, the device consumes 4 more fuel units for a single charge. The size of Small consumes half as less charges as Medium, down to ¼ the normal charges if Tiny (round down).

Devices have enough capacity for fuel units as appropriate to their type; Gadgets and Creatures can have up to 10 charges and consumables only require 1 fuel charge. Firearms and crossbows can have enough fuel for their Capacity, but have different fueling systems (see the appropriate entry above).

A construct and gadget can always have separate fuel containers, which expand its capacity to what it can hold (see Container Capacity in Chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook).

##### Fuel Units for Constructs
| Rarity | Tiny | Small | Medium | Large | Huge | Gargantuan |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Common | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1 | 4 | 8 | 16 |
| Uncommon | 1/2 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 10 | 18 |
| Rare | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 20 |
| Epic | 1 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 14 | 22 |
| Legendary | 2 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 24 |
| Artifact | 2 | 5 | 10 | 14 | 18 | 26 |

##### Device Engine and Schools
A device’s energy source determines how often it can recharge, how it malfunctions, and various other traits. If making a new device, the energy source is adjudicated between the player and DM, such as a DM allowing alchemical, combustion, and mechanical engines for firearms (alchemical fire-spitters, regular firearms, and augmented crossbows, respectively) but banning necromantic engines for the same task (if the technology hasn’t reached that level, or the tinker would have not yet conceivably known of the secrets of that energy source).

For example, using a gadget to cast the mana burn spell is possible by using the arcane or alchemical engines, but not if combustion, mechanical, or steam engines.

| Engine | School |
|:-:|:-:|
| Alchemy | These engines replicate all the spells on the Alchemist's spell list, as well as any ones that fit its theme of affecting objects and support effects. |
| Combustion | These engines replicate Evocation spells |
| Electric | These engines replicate Evocation spells, and most movement-affecting spells |
| Mana | These engines can replicate most spells with ‘mana’ in their name, as well as all spells from a single spell list (chosen when the engine is determined) |
| Mechanical | These engines replicate some Evocation and Illusion spells |
| Soul | Spells from the divination, conjuration, enchantment, and necromancy spells are replicated by soul engines |

As an example, a mana engine built for a priest (such as Draenei crystalline technologies) may store holy power and release blasts of light, while a mana engine built for a warlock (such as Burning Legion technologies) can instead unleash bolts of fel power.

The only devices that can replicate healing spells are with the alchemy, electric, mana, and soul engines.

##### Alchemical Engine (Potions)
The device is powered by alchemical powers. A single potion can provide fuel units according to the below table. An alchemical engine cannot use temporary potions (such as those made by the Inurement Alchemist feature).

\pagebreakNum

| Rarity | Fuel Units |
|:-:|:-:|
| Common | 10 |
| Uncommon | 25 |
| Rare | 50 |
| Epic | 75 |
| Legendary | 100 |

Excess fuel units are wasted beyond the units needed for 10 charges. If the excess fuel exceeds double the maximum capacity of the device, the device instead gains a Superfunction (see the Tinker feature of the same name). If two different potions are mixed inside the tank, roll for miscibility as normal (the DM is to adjudicate the results appropriately).

##### Combustion (Oil/Gas/Powder)
The device is powered by combustion of various fuels to provide a burst of energy. So long as fuel remains in the tank, the device can function. A single pint of gas or oil, or a pound of gunpowder can grant 1 fuel unit. A vial of phlogiston provides 5 fuel units.

For the purposes of energy sources, firearms and explosives use combustion, but use two ounces of gunpowder instead. You do not have to pay an additional cost with bombs, but must supply gunpowder and bullets (or pellets) for firearms. A device with the combustion engine gives as much sound as an explosive when it is used (usually muffled if inside a construct). Developed settlements familiar with firearms usually sell bullets and pellets already pre-packaged with gunpowder (increasing the cost of a bullet).
___
*Special.* Gunpowder is extremely efficient when it comes to firearms and explosives; a single fuel charge of a medium firearm or a single explosive consumes 2 ounces of gunpowder (or 1/8th a pound). This applies for light, medium, and heavy firearms of all rarities. When created for larger sizes, such as gnome-sized explosives, or cannons and ballistae (larger-than-normal firearms and crossbows, respectively), account for the changes appropriately (referring to the chart above).

##### Electricity (Batteries)
The device is powered by electrical energies. A single battery costs 50 gold, weighs one pound, and can store up to 5 fuel units. Batteries are tiny items coated with iron and made up of various materials.

A battery can be charged by lightning spells (in which case recharging it acts as a mana engine). For this purpose, the lightning spell’s base mana cost is transferred into charges for the device (before calculating reductions). If struck by lightning or a hazard that deals lightning damage that is not a spell, the device regains charges equal to one-tenth the damage the effect dealt. Granting an electrical engine more charges than its capacity automatically causes a malfunction.

##### Mana Engine (Mana)
The device is powered by a combination of mana-focusing lenses and raw energies, and stores raw mana. 1 mana point provides 1 fuel unit.

A spellcaster who is keyed to the device and is of the appropriate spellcasting class or mana type can charge the device with their mana.

Mana can be invested by linking a caster’s mana-flow to the device as an Action, which begins feeding off their own mana reserves, refueling the device, effectively draining mana points until the caster cuts off the connection. Cutting off a connection does not require an action.

After charging a device, the caster’s own mana circulation is corrupted, and requires a Stamina saving throw against a DC of 20. On a failed check, the character suffers the distracted condition until they complete a long rest, with a distraction DC of 20.

A device cannot feed off the mana signatures of two different spellcasters, and must expend all its mana first. Each mana engine is keyed to a certain mana type (such as that of the Mage, Priest, or Warlock) which determines which mana types the device requires.

##### Mechanical (Clockwork/Springs)
The device is powered by springs, gears, and clockwork mechanisms. 1 fuel unit is gained by winding the mechanism designated in the device or creature. It takes 1 hour of winding a device to grant it 1 mechanical fuel unit. If you are proficient with Engineer’s Tools or Tinker’s Tools, it takes 10 minutes instead, and grants 3 units.

If the device loses hit points and isn’t a construct, or isn’t used for 7 days, it loses 10% its maximum fuel units (minimum 1 unit).

An exception is using mechanical engines for crossbows (modified firearms). Charging such devices adds the [reload] property to the device instead. Larger crossbows (ballistae) require an Action to reload (plus an additional Action per size above medium-sized), and no longer require proficiency to wind.
___
*Special.* Explosives can be created using mechanical engines, but they deal only a type of physical damage (choose from Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing), and deal the damage in d4 instead of d6. If a rocket, it has half the normal range.

##### Variant Mechanical: Chaos Energy
Chaos energy is highly dangerous; some believe it actually is equivalent to arcane magic, although it can be harnessed by tinkers. Thought at first to be magical, as it can sometimes mimic the effects of arcane magic, chaos energy is purely mechanical in nature. Chaos energy is generated through the use of devices called chaos generators. A small box contains magnets, several differing kinds of metal, a bit of steam energy and a tiny golden core that vibrates at a high frequency when powered. Political maneuverings by wizards in Theramore have caused the ruling body to declare chaos generators unlawful, but the goblins and some gnomes still manage to research and develop new uses for chaos energy. The Horde hasn't outlawed the usage yet, as it is not arcane magic, but they are suspicious of it because of the similarities.

##### Soul (Spirits or Necromancy)
This engine is powered by soul-magic. This can be keyed to any creature type except constructs (humanoids, beasts, undead, elementals, etc.) Once keyed, the soul engine requires a source of spirit power, or it can harvest spirit power as it functions.

\pagebreakNum

**Spirit Power Source.** A spirit engine is usually powered by a spirit entrapped within by the essence seal spell (usually in the form of a soul gem). The soul engine gains 2 fuel units per Challenge Rating point of the spirit entrapped within (minimum 1 fuel unit at CR ½). Multiple creatures can be sealed together to fuel one device (counting the total Challenge Rating to determine the maximum Charges), subject to the same maximum fuel capacity.

At the end of a long rest (or 24 hours) of its last use, the entrapped spirits regain part of their power, restoring a number of fuel units to the device equal to one-quarter their total Challenge Rating(s).

For example, five creature of CR 3 are entrapped with the essence seal spell is used as fuel for a Meat Wagon, providing 30 fuel units (enough to keep it functioning for 5 straight hours). After 24 hours of its last use, it regains 7 fuel units.
___
**Spirit Power Reap.** If the device defeats or reduces the Hit Points of a creature of the same creature type as its engine (such as a flamethrower fueled by elemental spirits vaporizing a CR 4 water elemental), it regains a number of fuel units equal to half the target’s Challenge Rating (or 2).

Gaining excess fuel above the device’s limit from defeating creatures has a 10% chance of causing a malfunction to the devices.

The maximum number of fuel units the engine can store is equal to the Charges required for 10 uses of the device.

Most soul engines without a bound creature have a backup engine (usually mechanical or electricity). This has fuel enough for one charge.
___
*Special.* Having multiple souls with conflicting interests may cause the device to malfunction if used against at least two souls’ wish two opposite courses of action.

Trapped spirits also often try to call upon creatures that can aid them, and typically pledge aid or reward for being released (though they are under no compulsion to actually fulfill their promise). Such spirits can also intercept attempts at Calling (see Chapter 10: Spellcasting) to be heard by psychically or spiritually-sensitive individuals, sometimes even offering them information of their master’s weaknesses. This often happens with elemental spirits, often calling to shamans who meditate nearby.

##### Steam (Coal)
The device is powered by steam-power. 4 pounds of coal yield 1 fuel unit.

A steam-powered device requires a small furnace (either within it, as a mecha or construct, or outside it if a gadget).

##### Exterior Fuel Containers
It is possible to hook a device using mana or electrical engines to fuel containers or outlets, such as wiring an electric jumper cable to a giant battery, or a mana device to a mana fountain, or even a waterwheel or windmill for mechanical devices.

In this case, the item gains 5 fuel units per hour of being hooked up. Overcharging beyond maximum capacity might cause a malfunction if not attended to.

\pagebreakNum

### Infusion Kit
The infusion skill allows for the infusion, diffusion, and manipulation of magical items via infusion dust. A magical item, when created, requires investing crafting: Infusion Dust (ID) to reach a level of rarity (from Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, or Artifact).
___
**Prerequisites.** Infusion requires at least 4 caster levels and an Intelligence of 15 or higher to become proficient with. You can use the Infusionist feat to gain proficiency with the Infusion Kit.

| Infusion | Complexity |
|:-:|:-:|
| Common | Very Simple |
| Uncommon | Simple |
| Rare | Moderate |
| Epic | Complex |
| Legendary | Highly Complex |
| Artifact | Highly Complex |
___
An infusionist requires the formula for an infusion matrix, which can be discovered, rewarded, or found. Infusing an item costs the CP for an item of its complexity. If it is a consumable (such as a scroll), its cost is reduced as described above. Sometimes, infusion matrices are found in spellbooks.
#### Greater Attunement Items
Some items are known as ‘greater attunement’ items. These draw their power from the strength of their wielders, usually either due to requiring specific strength to unlock further powers, or by tying their own power with that of their wielder (see the below table). A character may only have one greater attuned item at any given time.

When not attuned to any creature, they appear as uncommon quality, but their true potential for power can be sensed by any who identify them.

Crafting a greater attunement item can be done at Uncommon rarity, but require upgrading the rarity (and the associated price) as normal. If already accessing the highest rarity step (as appropriate for character level), creating a greater attunement item costs as the highest-level rarity. For monsters, use its Challenge Rating instead of character level.

| Character Level | Item Rarity | Effect |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1st | Uncommon | Item becomes a +1 weapon |
| 3rd |	Uncommon | Item becomes magical (if a weapon) |
| 5th | Rare | Item becomes a +2 weapon or +1 armor |
| 11th | Epic | Item becomes a +3 weapon or +2 armor |
| 17th | Legendary | Item becomes a +3 armor |
___
Some greater attunement items have other effects on rarity instead of gaining a bonus to attack and damage rolls or AC.

#### Conditional Rarity
If crafting a greater attunement weapon and adding conditions for its improvement in rarity, the total cost of the item is reduced by 15%. This is subject to joint player-DM approval.

#### Golems
Golems can be created in conjunction with engineering. This requires a construct crafted with the golem modification, and is inert until suffused with the infusion skill. The matrix's rarity is relative to the creature's own.

For example, a harvester golem costs an additional 4,000 gp in infusion materials, but improves their mental ability scores and allows the device to function forever without fuel.

#### Runeblades
A death knight's runeblade rarity automatically increases with his level. Upon reaching 5th level, the blade becomes uncommon in quality, rare at level 10, etc. Upon reaching 20th level, the runeblade may reach Legendary quality if the Lich King allows it. Typically, the Lich King will elevate only one runeblade to legendary quality, with the chosen Death Knight being his champion until the blade is destroyed or the Death Knight disappoints him.

#### Custom Infused Items
Using infusion, you can craft custom infused items by mixing infusion matrices and enchanting normally-mundane items into masterpieces of work. First you must determine the base rarity of the infused item, and then add features to determine its ultimate rarity.

##### Base Rarity
This depends on the material. Most materials have a base rarity of common (no modification), but uncommon materials (such as adamantite or arcanite) have special features to account for their increased cost.
___
**Adamantite or Arcanite (Uncommon).** Objects made of adamantite or arcanite have an AC of 23, are immune to nonmagical weapon damage and are resistant to arcane damage, and have 30 hit points. If a weapon, it deals double damage to objects. If an armor, any critical hit you suffer while wearing it turns into a normal hit. Arcanite can be created by transmuting thorium and paying 50 gp in fire crystal materials for each pound of thorium, and casting the transmute material spell. Arcanite has the deep infusion for no cost.
___
**Bloodstone (Uncommon).** Objects made of bloodstone reflect the dim red of mortals, despite holding fel blood within, and are immune to fel damage, resistant to nonmagical weapon damage, and have 20 hit points. If used or worn, Bloodstone weapons and armor suppress fel addiction. Furthermore, you reduce the cost of all fel or unholy infusions by reducing 75% of the item's crafting cost.
___
**Dark Iron (Uncommon).** Objects made of dark iron have an AC of 18, are resistant to nonmagical weapon damage, and have 20 hit points. If a weapon, it deals double damage to objects. They also have the deep infusion for no cost.
___
**Brightwood (Uncommon).** Objects made of Brightwood acts as steel or wood, whichever is best suited for the occasion; it does not rust nor conduct electricity as normal steel, and it does not easily burn nor rot as normal wood, and can hold an edge. Brightwood also naturally regrows; so long as it is in a temperate and relatively humid area, objects made of Brightwood regain 1 hit point every minute.

\pagebreakNum

**Elementium (Rare).** Has traits of Arcanite, and is also resistant to all elemental damage (acid, cold, fire, and lightning). Furthermore, weapons and armor made of elementium reduce the cost of all elemental infusions by reducing 75% off the item's crafting cost. An Elementium weapon or armor also either gains the Elemental Damage feature for no cost (choose the damage type) or the Attuned Resistance feature for no cost. Finally, it has 1 additional spell use or 2 charges (if infused with the Spell or Charged Infusion features, if the spells are elemental in nature).
___
**Fel Iron (Uncommon).** Objects made of this mineral shed a fel glow in a radius of 10 feet, are immune to holy damage, resistant to nonmagical weapon damage, and have 20 hit points. If used or worn, fel iron weapons and armor sate fel addiction. Furthermore, you reduce the cost of all fel or unholy infusions by reducing 75% of the item's crafting cost.
___
**Iron or Steel (Common)**
___
**Lightforged Iron (Uncommon).** Objects made of this mineral shed regular light in a radius of 10 feet, are immune to shadow damage, resistant to nonmagical weapon damage, and have 20 hit points. If used or worn, Lightforged weapons and armor suppress fel addiction. Furthermore, you reduce the cost of all light or holy infusions by reducing 75% of the item's crafting cost.
___
**Mithril (Uncommon).** Objects made of mithral have half the weight of iron or steel but is just as hard, and does not rust, corrode, or tarnish. If a weapon, it is counted as if silver. If an armor, it can be worn under normal clothes if it is light or medium. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Agility (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't. If the item has a Deep Infusion, the final crafting cost of the item is reduced by 75%.
___
**Saronite (Rare).** Objects made of Saronite have an AC of 25 and 40 hit points, and are naturally magical. Objects made of Saronite are also immune to nonmagical weapons, resistant to magical weapon damage, and shadow, fel and lightning damage. When suffering holy or arcane damage, the object takes damage normally, and also deals half of the damage it took in a 15-foot area sphere centered on it (Spirit saving throw DC 15 to negate). Saronite is strong but brittle, and takes full damage from critical hits. Prolonged exposure to Saronite counts as a test of sanity (see Alternate Madness under Chapter 8). Saronite objects also have the deep infusion for no cost.
___
**Thorium (Uncommon).** Objects made of thorium have an AC of 20 and have 25 hit points, and are resistant to nonmagical weapon damage and arcane damage. They also have the deep infusion for no cost.
___
**Truesilver (Rare).** Has the traits of both Mithril and Thorium. A Truesilver weapon or armor gains a Deep Infusion for no cost (increasing its bonus to Attack and Damage rolls, or the AC gained by +1), and has 1 additional spell use or 2 charges (if infused with the spell or charged infusion features).

<div class="classTable wide">

##### Inscribed Features
**Ability Enhancement (+1 step, requires attunement, any).** When attuned to this item, it increases two ability scores by 1 each, to a maximum of 20. You can never benefit from two ability enhancement infusions. Ability enhancements are usually named and recognized in-universe by a creature-related suffix (such as Longsword of the Tiger or Bracers or the Dragon; see the below chart)

| Roll | Suffix | Strength | Agility | Stamina | Intelligence | Spirit | Charisma |

</div>

\pagebreakNum

**Attuned Resistance (+1 step, requires attunement, Armor only).** For one step, you may gain resistance to a chosen elemental or magic damage type for 1 hour when wearing this armor (chosen when choosing this feature). For two steps, the resistance is permanent.
___
**Charged Infusion (+1 step, Any).** You can charge an item with inner power, allowing it to gain multiple spells and abilities, spending charges to fuel them. When making a charged infusion, the item’s base rarity changes to reflect the rarity in the below chart. If the base item was an unusual material (such as mithril), add one step to the final rarity of the item per rarity above Common of the base material.

When creating a charged infusion, you may choose spells and abilities to store in your weapon, which expend charges upon being used. You must be able to cast these spells. At the start of every dawn or dusk (your choice upon infusion), the item regains charges as appropriate to its rarity. You use your spell save DC and attack bonus for the ability DCs, or otherwise use the specified DCs.

| Rarity (DC) | Spell levels | Max. charges (charges regained) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Common (12) | 3 | 5 (1d4) |
| Uncommon (13) | 5 | 10 (1d6) |
| Rare (14) | 7 | 10 (1d8 + 2) |
| Epic (15) | 10 | 10 (1d8 + 4) |
| Legendary (16) | 13 | 15 (1d8 + 4) |
| Artifact (17) | 16 | 20 (2d8 + 4) |

Each spell consumes 1 charge per spell level, and can be heightened to the maximum spell level appropriate for its rarity (see above). You can also inscribe cantrips (which cost ½ a spell level), but you cannot store a spell level without storing one at least two levels below it (for instance, storing a 6th level spell requires at least one 4th level spell, and one 2nd level spell). Once accessing a certain desired spell level, you can sacrifice access to lower spell levels and bind the item to the highest-level spell, refunds half the total spell levels of this infusion (in the above example, storing a 6th level spell costs 6 + 4 + 2 total spell levels, equivalent to 12 at Legendary rarity. Choosing to bind the 6th level spell counts the total spell levels spent as 6 instead of 12). This cannot reduce rarity below that appropriate to the original spell level before the refund (Legendary in this case).

If you expend the last charge on an inscribed item, roll 1d20. On a 1, the item is destroyed in a way appropriate to the type of the spells stored in it (becoming a mundane stick or twisted sword, melting, turning to ash, or disintegrating in display of power). If the item can only be destroyed in a specific way, it instead becomes inert until it is reinvigorated. The DM decides the method of invigoration, but it is usually similar in time and cost to the process of creation.

You may imbue an inscribed item with a special quality instead of adding spells. Each special quality can be purchased by spending spell levels as if they were inscribed.
___
**Aligned Infusion (2 spell levels per sub-school or archetype suite, or 4 for one magic school).** Choose one school of magic, or a sub-class of spell. You can channel mana from your surroundings as a bonus action before casting this spell, reducing the mana cost of spells of that type by one less mana point (minimum 1). You may choose evocation as a school or magic, for example, or choose fire, cold, or lightning spells, and spend a bonus action to reduce the mana cost of the spell by 1. You must use the item as the focus for this spell, and it becomes a spell focus for you.
___
**Enhanced Infusion (2 spell levels).** The weapon becomes a magical one. If the rarity is uncommon, it has a +1 bonus to attack and damage (3 spell levels). If the rarity is rare, it has a +2 bonus (4 spell levels). If the rarity is epic, it has a +3 bonus (5 spell levels). This cannot be taken when the Deep Infusion feature is taken.
___
**Guiding Infusion (1 spell level, requires Enhanced Infusion).** You may add the item’s bonus damage on attack and damage rolls to spell attack rolls.
___
**Insightful Infusion (1 spell level).** If you notice an illusion spell, you can attempt Intelligence (Investigation) checks without spending an action, but only once per turn. This must be at least one illusion spell stored in the item.
___
**Mana Storing (special).** The item can store a number of mana points equal to the maximum spell level it can store. Drawing from this pool does not cost an action, but it counts against the normal 1 hour limit of mana restoration effects. There must be at least one transmutation spell stored in the item. This special quality costs one-quarter of the number of spell levels of the item (round up).
___
**Reflective Infusion (1 spell level).** If you succeed on a save against a spell that targets only you, with or without the item's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the item and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell. There must be at least three abjuration spells stored in the item.
___
**Resistant Infusion (2 spell levels)**. You gain resistance to one elemental damage type while holding the item. This cannot be taken when the Attuned Resistance feature is taken.
___
**Smiting Infusion (4 spell levels).** When you hit with a melee attack using the item, you can expend up charges (up to the maximum spell level the weapon can store). For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra ld6 points of damage. The bonus damage is arcane. The item must be a staff or club (of any kind).
___
**Soothing Infusion (1 spell level).** If you fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn a failed save into a successful one. This must be at least one enchantment spell stored in the item.
___
**Warding Infusion (2 spell levels, requires enhanced infusion).** You may add the item’s bonus damage on attack and damage rolls to your to Armor Class and saving throws. There must be at least one abjuration spell stored in the item. The item must be a staff or club.

This infusion is usually chosen for staves. A DM may allow a spellcaster to gain the proficiency in infusion tools and the recipe for the purposes of making a single personalized inscribed staff (as inspiration, see Chapter 4).

\pagebreakNum

**Crusader (+1 step, Weapon only).** You enhance a melee weapon to invigorate a combatant. On a critical hit, a weapon infused with the Crusader infusion allows the user to spend 1 Hit Dice to heal themselves, and have the inner fire spell cast on them. This triggers on critical hits that are a result of natural roll (such a natural 20), and not from conditions that turn a successful attack into a critical hit (such as attacking a dying opponent).
___
**Deep Infusion (+1 step, Weapon, Shield, or Armor only).** For each step of rarity, add +1 to your Attack and Damage rolls with a weapon, or +1 to AC with an armor or shield, and the item is considered magical. This can be taken multiple times (each time adding +1 to a maximum of +3).
___
**Elemental Damage (Flame, Freeze, Lightning, Corrosion; Weapon only).** For each step, add 1d6 points of fire, cold, lightning, or acid (choose one) damage on a hit (maximum 3d6 with three levels). You can choose multiple elements, including two opposing ones.
___
**Health Infusion  (+1 step, Armor only).** This armor is infused with protective warding enchantments. So long as you are wearing this armor (and attuned to it, if it requires attunement), you gain a +5 bonus to your maximum hit points. This can increase rarity multiple steps, each adding 5 extra hit points (maximum +25 hit points at Artifact rarity).
___
**Magical Damage (Radiant, Demonic, Death, Mystic; Weapon only).** For each step, add 1d4 points of holy, fel, shadow, or arcane (choose one) damage on a hit (maximum 3d4 with three levels). You can choose multiple magic damages, including two opposing ones.
___
**Protection Ward (+1 step, Wonderous Item only).** This wondrous item (any item of clothing) is infused with wards of protection and resilience. So long as you are attuned to and are wearing this item, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and to all Saving Throws. You can be attuned to only one instance of Protection Ward. This infusion replaces the Cloak of Protection and the Ring of Protection wonderous items.
___
**Ricochet Infusion (+1 step, Weapon only).** This infusion can be placed only on a melee or thrown weapon. If it does not normally have the thrown property, it becomes a thrown weapon 20/60 ft. When you make a ranged thrown attack with this weapon, it flies out and targets another creature within 30 feet from the original target, counting its current target as its point of attack for the purposes of range. This does not require successfully striking the first target, but does require an attack action for each target. When the weapon cannot make any more attacks (such as you running out of attack actions), it returns to your hand at the end of your turn in the same round. You can make an attack with a bonus weapon as if using two-weapon fighting if the weapon normally qualifies. The weapon can ricochet up to a maximum number of times equal to 1 per its end rarity (once if Uncommon, five times if Artifact, etc.), so long as you have the attacks to expend. Night elven priestesses of Elune often grant a Ricochet-infused weapon (usually a moonglaive) to huntresses who have served well and protected the lands of Ashenvale and the Priesthood of Elune.
___
**Spell (+1 step, Any).** You imbue a single spell per rarity rank in the item, which can be invoked to cast the spell. The spell’s level is dependent on its quality (see the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table). You can increase the number of lower-level spells cast by 3 if you sacrifice the spell one rank higher than it.

For instance, a Legendary rarity item can cast 1 spell of level 7-8, 1 of levels 5-6, 1 of levels 3-4, and 1 of levels 1-2, or it can cast 4 of level 5-6, and 4 of levels 1-2.
___
**Storm Infusion (+1 step, Weapon only).** This weapon deals +1 extra thunder damage per step of the weapon’s end rarity (+1 for Uncommon, +5 for Artifact). Furthermore, when thrown, the storm weapon returns at the same round, and may be used again with another attack action. Wildhammer shamans often grant their gryphon riders a Storm-infused weapon (usually a warhammer) upon proving their quality and protecting Aerie Peak.
___
**Weapon Resistance (adds attunement; +2 steps, Armor only).** You gain resistance to nonmagical damage while wearing this armor. You can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 1 minute. If taken again, this increases the immunity’s duration to 3 minutes (at 3 steps), again to 10 minutes (at 4 steps), and again to 1 hour (at 5 steps).

##### Single-Use Enhancements
Temporary enhancements to weapons or ammunition can also be infused to contain a strike or shot effect if it is prepared specifically to hold it with an Infusion Kit. As this is infused with the ammunition itself, using it does not require a bonus action (but cannot be joined with another shot spell).

Ammunition are treated as both consumables and ammunition (enchanting 20 pieces of ammunition costs one-half the normal cost of the same quality). Despite the names below, ammunition infusions can be used interchangeably between ammunition such as arrows, crossbow bolts, bullets, and more. Ammunition infusions fade after a successful hit, and can be reused if they missed.

For the purposes of spellcasting ability rolls for strike effects, treat the bonus as +4.

Single use enhancements may be also stored into stones or gems, which can be sold by themselves, and used to confer the enchantment to a single weapon (or 20 pieces of ammunition) with an action. Once this is done, the weapon is enchanted for a single use, and the stone or gemstone loses the enchantment.

| Name | Rarity/EP | Spell (Spell Level) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Arcane | Uncommon | Shot Array (Arcane); or 1d4 arcane damage, dispel magic (1st level) |
| Black | Rare | Shot Array (Black); or 3d4 shadow damage, conjure undead I |
| Fire | Uncommon | Shot Array (Searing); or 1d6 fire damage |
| Sleep | Uncommon | Shot Array (Tranquilizing); or 5d8 hit points of sleep |

##### Item Naming
An item
Item names have three steps: Lesser, Greater, and Superior
For example, an axe made of elementium with three steps of elemental damage (fire) is called an Axe of Superior Flame, or a Superior Elementium Axe of Fire, and deals 3d6 extra points of fire damage on a hit.

### Poisoner’s Kit
A character proficient with a poisoner’s kit may gain immunity to any disease or poison they know how to create by subjecting themselves to it and surviving the ordeal. This requires three instances of surviving the poison or the disease, and no more than three times over the course of a year. A poison or disease must be recovered from naturally to count towards immunity.

| |
|:-:|:-:|
| Rarity | Complexity |
| Common | Very Simple |
| Uncommon | Simple |
| Rare | Moderate |
| Epic | Complex |
| Legendary | Highly Complex |
| Artifact | Highly Complex |

#### Using Poisons
Applying poisons is a Use Object action if they are not used as weapons. If applied to a weapon, poisons retain potency for one minute or until used. Poisons are applicable to up to three hits. A creature multiple times with a single poison suffers disadvantage to the saving throw of the poison.

Depending on the vector of the poison, it takes different shapes.
___
**Contact.** Applying poisons to a door handle delivers contact poisons, and costs an action.
___
**Ingested.** Applying poisons to a bowl or cooked meal delivers ingested poisons. If diluting a dose (such as putting a dose in a cooking pot or a well), the DC is reduced by 4, but a single dose affects 4 targets.
___
**Inhaled.** Cracking eggshells made of pottery or porcelain delivers inhaled poisons (treat as potions in regards to range, with a 10-foot radius cloud), and are treated as improvised weapons.
___
**Injury.** Applying poisons to the tip of an arrow or within a syringe delivers injury poisons.
___
The default DC of each poison is 13, although proficient users have DCs as follows:
___
**Poison Saving Throw DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus +

your Intelligence Modifier
___
Crafting poisons requires proficiency in a poisoner’s kit and materials. Poisons can be crafted using alchemical crafting materials of the same components, or ingredients of the same cost (such as coming across 100 gp worth of a lesser demon’s blood, or 200 gp worth of deathweed). Their cost is that of a consumable under the appropriate rarity (see the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table).

# Chapter 8: Adventuring

The following rules for adventuring apply in the Warcraft universe.

## Alternate Madness
**Optional rule**
___
When your players exposed to the whispers of the Old Gods, their minds are touched. This can occur when a Call they make is answered by such eldritch beings (even if the answer isn't at the moment they expect), or when they rest in a place of eldritch power (such as on a ship sailing above a drowned temple or in Tirisfal Glades). Creatures with higher Spirit scores are more sensitive to these whispers (and also more resistant to them). The key with insanity is that the players' psyches are unreliable, with their mind either reeling and trying to cope, breaking down and trying to delay the gibbering madness, or hobbling on with anxieties and depressing thoughts.

If exposed this way, you can decide if a certain event is a test of a character's sanity. There are 5 levels of sanity (as exhaustion). When exposed to a test of sanity, a Spirit or Charisma saving throw is required to avoid suffer a level of madness.

Roll secretly for a creature’s mania or insanity.

| Level | Effect |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Disadvantage on Ability Checks |
| 2 | Confused for a total of 1 minute per 24 hours (stressful situation or declared by DM) |
| 3 | Disadvantage to attack rolls and saving throws (including against future stress) |
| 4 | Hit Point Maximum halved. If having an active mana pool, Hit Point and Mana Point - Maximums are reduced by one-quarter |
| 5 | Confused for a total of 1 hour per 24 hours (stressful situation or declared by DM) |
| 6 | Irrecoverably insane |
___
Depending on the character's background, personality traits, and history, some tests of sanity might be passes automatically. For instance, a warrior whose family was murdered in a raid might treat a moderate test as a minor test.

| Severity | DC | Example |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Minor | 10 | Stress from failed expectations |
| Moderate | 15 | Loved one murdered or betrayed |
| Major | 20 | Loved one murdered or betrayed the character |
___
Non-sentient beings are immune to insanity. Sentient beings that are constructs or undead (such as the Forsaken) are immune to insanity if they are bound (such as by the bind spell) to a creature.
___
**Coping and Recovery.** Taking certain actions can stem off insanity from worsening or enable healing. When having at least one level of madness, a character can adopt a coping mechanism. Roll randomly to choose a coping mechanism for a character. So long as the character is staying true to the restrictions of the coping mechanism, they ignore the penalties of one level of madness, and can recover from a level of insanity after a long rest. A character can choose to ignore or abandon their coping mechanism (such as sleeping for normal duration or refraining from violence), which returns the penalties and prevents the character from recovering.

A character abandoning their coping mechanism for too long may cause it to be changed (at the DM's discretion). A character can petition the DM to change their coping mechanism by spending inspiration (such as fulfilling a bond). One insanity is lifted, the character has no need to cope and can drop the mechanism.

All coping mechanisms are treated as character Flaws. Therefore, whenever a coping mechanism causes a character to suffer a narrative drawback (such as angering an important NPC with an insulting instance of paranoia, hiding from a critical confrontation, etc.), the character gains inspiration.

You may later spend inspiration to ignore one instance of coping (such as refusing an addictive substance to help a friend). If you succeed on the task and stay true to one of your personality traits, bonds, or ideals, the inspiration is not spent and can be used again.

You may roll randomly for a character (1d12 and choose one of the below) or choose one that is relevant to the character’s previous action or backstory.

\pagebreakNum

<div class="classTable wide">

| Dice | Result |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | **Addictive Dysfunction (Greed, Gluttony, or Lust).** The character frequently indulges in their addiction (substance or behavior) to cope. The DM sets the frequency of the addiction. The more time the character spends without indulging their addiction, the greater the rebound if unable to change the coping mechanism. If choosing food or drink, the character often eats three times the amount of a normal person (or pays lifestyle expenses one step higher to feed their needs). |
| 2 | **Amnesia/forgetfulness.** The character locks away memories of bad things (or neutral things) they associate with the insanity. Communicate with the player the things their character might forget. |
| 3 | **Attachment.** The character becomes unhealthily attached to an object, person, or concept. Not having it (or if a person or concept, not living up to them or it) counts as if abandoning the mechanism. |
| 4 | **Compulsion.** The character gains a compulsion, and must perform it to cope with the madness. This could be a compulsive action or repetition. |
| 5 | **Delusions.** The character has a complete conviction of a certain thing.<br>Paranoia. The character sees evidence in people conspiring against them. This is usually false.<br>Pride. The character has inflated self-worth and too much confidence in their abilities, usually underestimating opposition.<br>Reference. The character falsely perceives messages and sees omens everywhere, identifying signs where there are none.<br>Selective Perception. The character sometimes suffers disadvantage to Perception checks (no more than 1/hour) if what they perceive would be something they don't want. |
| 6 | **Hallucinations.** The character interacts with hallucinations as if they are real (as provided by the DM or conjured alone). |
| 7 | **Elusiveness.** The character prefers to hide or evade problems, confrontation, or frightful situations unless there is no other solution. |
| 8 | **Envy.** The character is jealous towards other people’s accomplishments, and may seek to subvert them or claim them for themselves |
| 9 | **Narcissism.** The character prefers to perform acts that can benefit itself directly. |
| 10 | **Sociopathy.** The character acts with antisocial behavior (manipulation, lying, lacking empathy, sincerity, or trustworthiness). This can be masked with a charming exterior or left blatant. |
| 11 | **Sloth.** The character's short rests take 30 extra minutes, and the character's long rests take two extra hours (10 hours). |
| 12 | **Wroth.** The character handles their problems with disproportionate violence. They prefer to seek out violent situations or to resolve issues (even with allies) by bullying or browbeating them over compromise. |

</div>

How insanity works isn't merely taking away agency, it's empowering the character to adapt with madness. Insanity in the Warcraft universe is not mundane mental disorders--it almost always has a subtle influence of the Old Gods, due to the curse of flesh warping nearly every sentient race to being, or a fantastical exaggeration of the broken psyche. To that superior psyche, every race has a backdoor.

**Recovery.** Characters can recover from madness levels the same way they recover from exhaustion (once per long rest) so long as they stayed true to their coping mechanism when awake. A character must stay true to a coping mechanism for at least 24 full hours of staying awake.

## Cabal Casting and Cooperative Crafting
**Optional Rule**
___
Warlocks of the Burning Legion and necromancers of the Scourge are known to organize cabals and circles of power to channel their strength into beyond their normal limits. Similarly, goblin and gnomish tinkers have pooled their knowledge and expertise to cooperatively craft devices beyond the skill of any individual craftsperson.

Both concepts have an underlying basis: the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Mages and wizards of the Kirin Tor have long looked down on cabal casting, but have confronted the utility of them when orc warlocks who are less trained in magical arts bested their mage counterparts. They, too, however, recognize the strength in unity, as evidenced by those learned enough to know about the Guardians of Tirisfal, or of the great fire ritual used by the wizards of Arathor against the Troll empire ages past.

\pagebreakNum

### Cabal Spellcasting
Any casters of the same casting class (or derivatives, such as warlock and demon hunter, or mage and spell breaker) can pool their powers by willingly entering into a cabal circle. The circle need not be physical, but communication must be instantaneous (such as by using telepathy), and the members must be focused entirely on the task (treated as if they are channeling).

#### Entering a Cabal
Entering into a cabal consumes your movement for that round as you focus your attention, and you are treated as if you are channeling for the duration of the cabal chain. If you lose concentration, you exit the cabal until you establish yourself as a member in the chain once more.

When entering into a cabal chain, you must either defer to the existing head of the cabal, or propose yourself as cabal leader. Only the cabal leader may decide on the focus of the cabal’s attention.

When the cabal leader casts a spell, all the other cabal members must focus their attention on the spell. If at least one member choses to refrain, the cabal leader is roughly aware of the missing focus, and may choose to cancel casting the spell. If all members focus their attention, the spell level is heightened according to the number of members in the cabal, see below.

| Members | Caster Level | Spell Levels Heightened |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 3 | +2 | +1 |
| 7 | +4 | +2 |
| 13 | +6 | +3 |
| 42 | +8 | +4 |
| 101 | +10 | +5 |
___
When participating in cabal casting, each spellcaster in the cabal (as well as the cabal leader) must spend the resources to cast the specific spell (or their highest-level spell if they cannot access it) to empower the leader’s chosen spell. This applies to all resources required by the spell, except consumable material components; which are paid for once for each spell level heightened (once at 3 members, twice at 7 members, etc.).

Furthermore, the spell focused on must be a spell level all the members can cast, or at least of a spell level within two spell levels of the lowest-skilled member. Hence, a 20th level warlock (spell level 9), can join forces with a 20th level demon hunter (spell level 5) to cabal cast up to 7th level spells, but not 8th nor 9th level spells.

Instead of casting a spell, a cabal leader may instead have their effective caster level increased for the purposes of accessing spell scrolls of higher level without penalty.

When the spell’s casting time is complete, the cabal leader must roll an Intelligence (Arcana) skill check against a DC of 10. If the participants include a character of a different casting class but who shares the spell list (or has the spell on their spell list), the DC is 15 as the leader consolidates different magical traditions. If there is a skill that is more appropriate than Intelligence (Arcana), such as when priests use cabal casting, or if there is another ability score more appropriate (such as Charisma (Arcana) for warlocks), then that skill or ability score is required instead.

#### Successful Cabal Casting
On a success, the cabal’s efforts succeeded, and the spell is cast as if cast from a higher level (increasing the spell’s effects as normally described), and each member has to make a successful Constitution saving throw against a DC of 10 or suffer one level of exhaustion.

The spell acts as if the cabal leader had cast it for all purposes (such as who must concentrate, who a conjured creature obeys, etc.).

Depending on the number of allies with you, the potential number of spell levels the spell you cast increases (up to a maximum spell level of 9).

When a spell is heightened, the cabal leader may choose to apply one of the following Metamagic effects instead of heightening the spell (such as if when the spell has no effect when heightened):
___
**Accurate Spell.** When you cast a spell that requires a saving throw or spell attack roll, your spell save DC or spell attack roll bonus is increased by 1. This costs 1 spell levels, or 2 if you increase the bonus by 2 instead.
___
**Careful Metamagic.** When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. You may choose a number of creatures up to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. This costs 1 spell level.
___
**Distant Metamagic.** When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can make the range of the spell 30 feet. This costs 1 spell level.
___
**Empowered Metamagic.** When you roll damage for a spell, you can reroll a number of the damage dice up to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. This costs 1 spell level.
___
**Extended Metamagic.** When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. This costs 1 spell level.
___
**Intensified Metamagic.** When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. This costs 3 spell levels.
___
**Quickened Metamagic.** When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. This costs 2 spell levels. You can hold a quickened spell as a cabal leader for up to 1 hour, although you bear signs of holding such trapped power.
___
**Reabsorb Metamagic.** When you cast a spell modified with this Metamagic, you regain half the resources spent on casting it (minimum 0 mana or 0 gp in material components) if the target succeeds on their first saving throw against the spell, or if you fail your first attack roll to affect the target. This costs 1 spell level.
___
**Subtle Metamagic.** When you cast a spell, you can cast it without any somatic or verbal components. This costs 1 spell level.
___
**Twinned Spell.** When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can target a second creature in range with the same spell. To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are. This costs 1 spell level for each level of the spell that is used.

\pagebreakNum

In another example, a 9th level mage casting the geas spell with 7 allies (minimum level to contribute is level 5 wizards for two spell levels’ difference) heightens the spell by 2 spell levels, allowing the spell to act as if a 7th level spell. The duration of the spell becomes 1 year instead of 30 days (a feat which normally requires a 13th level wizard and a higher spell level). Instead of heightening the spell to 7th level, the cabal leader can instead use the 2 spell levels to apply the Distant and Subtle Metamagic effects, both increasing the range to 120 feet and removing all signs of spellcasting.

#### Failed Cabal Casting
On a failure by the cabal leader, 10% of the participants in the cabal (randomly chosen) are subject to system shock (as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 273) or a Wild Magic Surge (as described in the Player’s Handbook, page 98), DM’s choice. If the cabal leader is chosen by random, the cabal leader may attempt another skill check (against a DC of 20 instead of 10) to avoid being targeted, shifting the effect to another random participant instead.

For example, 3 apprentice mages (of caster levels 3) can pool their power together, increasing their chosen leader’s caster level to 5, allowing their leader to heighten their burning hands spell to 3rd level. If the cabal leader has a fireball scroll ready, he can cast it without risking a mishap. If the leader failed their Intelligence (Arcana) check, one of them is subject to either system shock or a Wild Magic surge.

#### Sub-Cabals
If the difference in accessed spell levels is too great, cabal members can form sub-cabals, each counting as their own sub-cabal leader, but acting as cabal members for the purpose of the main cabal.
For example, 101 1st level priests led by a particularly gifted student (the highest in Intelligence (Religion) or the relevant skill) will act as if they access 5th level spells, and count as a single eligible member for a cabal formed by a priest of 13th level to cast a 7th level spell.

There is no limit for the number of sub-cabals (or sub-sub cabals), but a failure of the cabal leader cascades to all sub-cabals below them, exposing them to disruptions, system shock failures, exhaustion for participants, or Wild Magic Surges. A failure by a cabal leader who is a member of the main cabal causes them to temporarily exit the cabal.

### Cooperative Crafting
Any crafters of the same crafting profession (alchemists, infusionists, tinkers, etc.) can pool their knowledge and resources by willingly entering into a cooperative crafting project. Their presence need not be physical, but communication must be instantaneous (such as by using telepathy), and the members must be focused entirely on the task (treated as if they are all focusing on crafting).

#### Entering a Cooperative Project
When entering into a cooperative project, you must either defer to the existing head of the project, or propose yourself as project leader. Only the project leader may decide on the focus of the team’s attention.

When the project leader chooses to craft an item, all the other team members must focus their attention on the same item. If all members focus their attention, the project leader’s effective level is heightened according to the number of members in the team, see below. This directly affects the project leader’s proficiency bonus, which in turn affects the rarity of items they can craft. The project leader must have access to the formula, schematic, matrix, or discovery to craft the item.

When participating in cooperative crafting, the cost of crafting is equal to the cost of crafting times each step of the team size (base cost at 3 members, triple the cost at 13 members, etc.).

| Members | Character Level | Cost of Crafting |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 3 | +2 | x2 |
| 7 | +4 | x3 |
| 13 | +6 | x4 |
| 42 | +8 | x5 |
| 101 | +10 | x6 |

Furthermore, the team’s members must be within four character levels of the team leader. Hence, a 16th level tinker, can join forces with a 12th level tinker, but not a 10th nor 7th level tinker.

When the item’s crafting time is complete, the team leader must roll an Intelligence check with the appropriate tool against a DC of 10.

#### Successful Team Crafting
On a success, the team’s efforts succeeded, and the item is crafted as if by a higher level craftsperson (increasing the rarity), and each member has to make a successful Constitution saving throw against a DC of 10 or suffer one level of exhaustion at the conclusion.
The item acts as if the team leader had cast it for all purposes (such as who applies various effects, various modifications, etc.).

Depending on the number of allies with you, the potential number of character levels the spell you cast increases (up to a maximum rarity of Artifact).
When their proficiency bonus is heightened, the team leader may choose to apply a technological modification increasing rarity (in the case of technological devices). Each potential proficiency point increase can be expended to gain a 1 EP modification.
If the project is alchemical in nature, the team leader can attempt to perform potion miscibility, and roll twice for each potential proficiency point.

For example, seven novice tinkers (of level 2) can pool their expertise together, increasing their chosen team’s effective character level to 6 (proficiency +3), allowing their leader to craft rare-quality items for double the normal cost (after applying the reductions from the Efficient Engineering feature).

##### Sub-Teams
If the difference in accessed character level is too great, team members can form sub-teams, each counting as their own sub-team leader, but acting as team members for the purpose of the main team.

\pagebreakNum

##### Mass Production
Once a Project Team is instituted, they act as the leader’s original level (not counting the cooperative crafting level increase) for the purposes of crafting, but only to replicate the focus of the project’s team particular item. This allows the team leader to continue producing while busy in other pursuits (such as spending downtime in training, managing an organization, traveling, or even adventuring).

For each successful crafting project completed by the Project Team, the leader must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma check with Engineer’s Tools. Whenever the Project Team accrues three failed checks (which do not need to be consecutive), the Project Team loses the ability to continue production of the item.

## Resurrection and Immortals
Resurrection in the Warcraft universe’s lore is a contentious subject; player characters can be revived, but important NPCs usually die permanently.

Resurrection is possible and expensive, although several factors make it easier, and some make it impossible.
___
**Intact Corpse.** An intact corpse is required for resurrection with the following spells: Revivify (3rd level), and raise dead (5th level). Missing body parts are not restored with these spells, and an armless corpse becomes an armless raised character. If the limb is required for life (such as a head), the resurrection fails.
___
**Free Soul.** Some spells and effects trap the soul, such as the imprisonment, or essence seal spells. Being alive also prevents returning to life, as the soul is technically trapped in the body it inhabits. An animated undead is treated as an imprisoned soul. A trapped soul must be freed before resurrected (such as breaking the imprisonment spell, destroying the essence seal focus, or destroying an animated undead).

If a soul is trapped in a focus (such as the essence seal spell or a soul-stealing sword), the one who casts the spell or evokes the effect must contest their spellcasting attribute with the target. On a success of two out of three rolls, the focus that traps the soul is broken and the soul is freed. Focuses that can be broken this way are explicitly stated to be subject to this effect.
___
**Willing Target.** The target must be willing to return. Some characters, upon a fulfilled life, find that they cannot (or are unwilling) to be revived. This cancels the spell without consuming any material components.
___
**Material Components.** Spells that raise the dead require expensive material components, such as diamonds (or their dust), alchemical reagents, or anything that can stand in for the price. For example, a cherished wedding band can pay the price of the spell if it has a comparable price (even if not exact), as well as a magical item with an infusion cost comparable to the spell’s cost.
___
**Resurrection Sickness.** Spells that revive inflict resurrection sickness. The target takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Whenever they take a long rest, the penalty decreases by 1 point until it is eliminated entirely.

### Immortals
Immortals such as celestials and fiends (sometimes known as outsiders), undead, and fey have different natures than mortals such as humanoids, beasts, etc. and do not age or die of aging.

Additionally, outsiders cannot be destroyed unless killed under certain conditions.

They must be killed on their native plane (the Twisting Nether for demons, and the native realm for celestials), or a plane heavily influenced by it, or

They must be gated in physically (via a gate or plane shift, or similar effects) such as when the lich Kel’Thuzad invited the archdemonic Archimonde via a gate to Azeroth during the Third War.

Few spellcasters know that outsiders do not die unless under these conditions (most of those who do know are warlocks who share this information sparingly). If a creature is bonded without being invited or gated in, they reform as normal.

Due to the difficulties of killing demons under these conditions, they are usually banished, trapped (either in gems, or spell focuses such as by the essence seal, or by spells such as imprisonment), or imprisoned instead of destroyed. In the case of the essence seal spell, ambitious spellcasters might even use the creature’s spirit to fuel infusions or to power engineering devices, though they run the risk the creature escapes.

Forsaken and other intelligent undead is another special case. So long as an undead is intelligent, it can be raised or revived by the normal raising spells (revivify, raise dead, and resurrection). Unintelligent undead are usually ‘revived’ by repeated animation.

Some undead often have special conditions to destroy beyond resurrection. For example, liches can only be killed if their phylacteries are destroyed.

Although undead also require their body parts to be available to be raised through these spells, it is easy to simply stitch body parts together with a sewing kit (or use body parts from other corpses), although the undead’s head is a vital and irreplaceable part.

The resurrection spell can, however, revert an undead creature to living, so long as its soul is free, but only if it is heightened to 9th level (also known as True Resurrection).

Creating intelligent undead requires more than just animating them; the Plague of Undeath was an unholy concoction suffused with necromantic and soul magics, and animated by semi-sentient will. Created by the Lich King before the beginning of the Third War, the Plague of Undeath is the strongest and most reliable tool to create intelligent undead (see equipment).

Should the Lich King’s telepathic control of his undead minions waver (either by suffering damage to himself or the Frozen Throne), there is a chance that these free-willed undead will summon back their spirits to their bodies, becoming intelligent undead—in many cases, joining the ranks of the Forsaken.
Intelligent undead usually appear in traumatic events that would cause their spirit to linger and return (executed unjustly, betrayed and killed by a loved one, died with broken oaths or severe regrets, slain on unholy ground, etc., as determined by the DM). Spellcasters may attempt to replicate these circumstances with the bind undead spell.

\pagebreakNum

Casting the bind spell on a corpse in an area that was significant to the person while alive may summon his spirit to be bound as an undead. Animating and then binding a human farmer in the ruins of a market he used to sell his wares in, an elven farstrider in her archery range, or an orc in his hut are all likely to return a sliver of the creature’s spirit, returning their mental attributes to normal. These undead, if released from the binding, join the ranks of the Forsaken.
___
**Fey.** Fey slain reform in the Emerald Dream, but do not regain physical bodies, such as the elder fey Cenarius.
___
**Constructs.** Constructs are considered functionally immortal, and can be fixed and recrafted by a character with a sufficiently high proficiency in Engineer’s Tools, although they cannot be restored if missing critical components (subject to joint DM-player adjudication).

## Retraining
This allows a character to change their class or a chosen class feature (such as a Warrior’s Fighting Style, a Tinker’s Patent, or even a character’s class). This takes 7 days and costs 25 gp per class level of the character. If multiclassing, retrain only the relevant class’s levels.

For instance, a Warrior 2/Tinker 5 who wishes to change her Fighting Style would take 14 days and 50 gp to change her Fighting Style or retrain her Warrior levels into something else, but 35 days and 125 gp to change her Patent.

## Strongholds
Whether it be human keeps, orc barricades, or a lone mage tower, strongholds serve as centers of important activity.

You may refer to the Kingdoms, Strongholds, and War rules for rules on building and customizing strongholds.

### Damaging Strongholds
Each 10 x 10-foot section (whether it be wall, room, or door) of a stronghold can be damaged. It has AC and hit points relevant to its material, and is immune to poison and psychic damage.

Reducing a section to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM’s discretion (usually if the attacker has the plans of the stronghold or is knowledgeable of masonry, such as having proficiency with the relevant artisan tool). A destroyed section suppresses a stronghold function (such as punching into a storage room or prison wall, exposing the contents or releasing prisoners, respectively).

A stronghold can be damaged with one spell that affects all sections in the spell’s area. If the effect or spell affects only one side of the stronghold (such as from the outside), add all hit points together, with the damage causing an indent equal to the amount of increments of damage compared to inches.

Therefore, a cottage made of wood that is enveloped in the area of an earthquake or death and decay spell applies its damage to all sections; possibly bringing down the stronghold with the single spell. If attacking with a fire bolt spell cast by an 11th level spellcaster (3d10, average of 16 damage), however, every two hits cause 32 damage, equivalent to 1 inch of wood burnt out.

| | | | | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Material | AC | Hit Points/Inch | Wall (1 foot) | Damage Threshold |
| Stone | 17 | 30 | 360 | 10 |
| Wood | 15 | 25 | 300 | 5 |

With spells like death and decay and earthquake, it typically takes around one minute of damage to reduce a building’s floor to rubble with this spell (average of 21 damage per round for death and decay and 10 per round for earthquake (or 50 for heightened earthquake), before comparing to the Damage Threshold).

### Siege Weapons and Bombardment
Siege weapons take a number of rounds on average, to destroy or breach a wall section. Setting up siege weapons is therefore a critical step that stronghold defenders must prevent, such as by sending outriders to harry or defeat the crew, sabotage with thieves’ tools, use their own siege weapons, building the stronghold in marshy terrain or behind moats, or preparing (or digging) tunnels that end behind enemy lines. The below chart assumes average damage, and walls one foot thick. Interior walls are half as thick (and take half the time to destroy).
___
*Note.* This assumes concentrated bombardment on the same 10 by 10 foot section. Usually in war, attacking commanders open multiple points of entry to overwhelm and demoralize defenders.

| Weapon | Damage/minute | Stone (1 foot thick) | Wood (1 foot thick) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Ballista* | 160 | 2 minutes | 1 minute 6 rounds
| Cannon* | 440 | 9 rounds | 7 rounds |
| Trebuchet* | 440 | 1 minute | 7 rounds |
| Mangonel* | 270 | 1 minute 4 rounds | 1 minute 2 rounds |  
| Ram | 160 | 2 minutes | 1 minute 6 rounds |
___
\* With these weapons, it is assumed the attacker has a full crew to maintain one attack per round (crew ranging from 3 to 5 for 3 to 5 actions each, as per their appropriate full descriptions). Without a full crew for the siege weapon, the damage takes longer (five times the normal time for trebuchets, for example).
___
These statistics assume the siege weapons in the Dungeon Master’s Guide for the purposes of backwards compatibility. Modified crossbows and firearms (field cannons, great ballista, etc.) are described in Chapter 7 under engineering.

#### Collapsing Buildings
A collapsing structure damages nearby creatures within half the structure’s height. Said creatures must make an Agility saving throw or else take 5d6 bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried. The DM can waive the damage entirely and entrap a character in a small area that has not caved in, though this still requires the above check to escape.

## Vehicles
Some vehicles are unique to the Warcraft universe, and have increased speeds and abilities over normal vehicles.

| Type | Cost | Speed | Crew/Passengers | Cargo | AC | HP | Threshold |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Goblin Zeppelin | 25,000 gp | 10 mph | 20/40 | 10 tons | 15 | 300 | 10 |
| Juggernaut | 40,000 gp | 4 mph | 60/400 | 250 tons | 17 | 600 | 20 |

</div>

##### Goblin Zeppelin (or Goblin Balloon)
The goblin zeppelin has one engine (huge sized uncommon) which counts as 15 crew members, leaving the ship requiring only 5 crew members. Without the engine, the goblin zeppelin acts as a normal airship, and loses 1 mile of flight speed, and 9 tons of cargo.

##### Juggernaut
The juggernaut has one engine (large-sized size rare) that counts as 30 crew members (costs 15,000 gp), leaving the ship requiring only 30 crew members. Without the engine, the juggernaut acts as a normal warship, and loses 1½ a mile of speed, and 50 tons of cargo.

# Chapter 9: Combat

## Actions in Combat

### Attack
When using an action to make an attack, some abilities (such as the Extra Attack feature or Haste) allow multiple attacks. In this case, each attack is considered a single ‘attack action’.

This conversion also makes use of several effects that affect combat, such as strike and stance effects. The character must choose to use their bonus action to fight (with an off-hand weapon or cast a spell or use an item) or to use a strike effect if they have one.

### Strikes and Shots
These are abilities or spells that consume a bonus action to execute and grant an additional effect on the first successful attack (or a number of successful attacks, depending on the description).

When using a strike effect, the use of a bonus action prevents using two-weapon fighting and use of off-hand natural attacks. Any character using a strike or shot effect can declare whether or not to use them for each attack action, or to withhold the effect until before the end of the duration. Shot spells are strike spells, but are restricted to ranged weapons.

For instance, a 9th level hunter can use a bonus action to cast the shot array: black arrow spell. The spell enchants 6 arrows, and allows them to deal 3d4 extra fel damage (with the ability to animate a target killed by the arrow). He may replace any normal arrow with a black arrow, until the arrows end or the enchantment fades after 1 minute.

### Stances
These are abilities or spells that usually restrict the character’s movement, but grant the bonus so long as they are conscious and acting. They usually require an action or a bonus action to enter (depending on the description). Some stances require moving less than half a character’s maximum speed, while others require constant movement. A character can only benefit of one stance at a given time.

### Tether
A character can tether another using rope, chain, or another mechanism to restrain its range of movement, without having to restrain the character (such as by a spell or using grappling).

If tethering two creatures, one side can perform the shove action, but instead of pushing away, the creature moves closer on a successful check. The creatures moves the same distance as they would if they were shoved normally.

If a character uses a grappling hook, they can tether a target reliably with a successful ranged attack roll, and then use their action the next round to pull them closer.

## Damage and Healing
Effects that deal holy damage and can heal the living give the option for the spellcaster to either heal or deal damage. The same goes for effects that deal shadow damage and heal (though it can only heal the undead or demons). These spells have the [healing] descriptor, or otherwise only harm.

For example, the holy light spell is a [healing] spell that can deal holy damage. If targeting a living being, the caster can choose to make it heal them instead. Death coil is also a [healing], though it can only heal the undead and demons, while dealing shadow damage at the will of the caster to other creatures.

### Damage Types
Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. The damage types follow, with examples to help a DM assign a damage type to a new effect.
___
**Arcane.** Arcane is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal arcane damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon. Effects that used to deal force damage deal arcane damage instead.
___
**Concussive.** Concussive damage is half bludgeoning, half thunder. Most effects that deal concussive damage as fueled by explosives.
___
**Holy.** Holy is a form of divine power focused to harm or heal (if it also has the healing descriptor), such as a paladin’s crusader strike or a holy light spell. Most effects that deal holy damage are fueled by divine beings. Effects that used to deal radiant damage deal holy damage instead.
___
**Shadow.** Shadow is the polar opposite of the holy light, and can also be used to harm or heal different creature types, such as a death knight’s runic strike or death coil. Most effects that deal shadow damage are fueled by dark beings such as void lords. Effects that used to deal necrotic damage deal shadow damage instead.
___
**Fel.** Fel damage is a semi-sentient form of magic that suffuses and corrupts living beings, and are usually spells, such as a warlock’s orb of annihilation or a fiend’s explosive death. Most effects that deal fel damage are fueled by fiends or the lords of the Burning Legion. Effects that used to deal necrotic damage and were of a demonic source deal fel damage instead.

### Damage Class
Often times, certain abilities describe damage classes.
___
**Physical damage** includes bludgeoning, piercing, slashing
___
**Elemental damage** includes acid, cold, fire, and lightning.
___
**Magic damage** includes arcane, holy, shadow, thunder, and fel.
___
Some damage effects deal one-half one damage and one-half another, such as concussive damage. In this case, divide the damage into its component halves before applying resistances.

## Optional Rules
The following optional rules are of particular suit to the Warcraft setting. These are from other sourcebooks, reproduced below for convenience.

\pagebreakNum

### Absorb Knockdown
In many cases, a creature might appear to be more resistant to being knocked prone by certain abilities. A tauren using a warstomp to knock a human footman is more easily visualized than using it to knock down a crypt lord or a giant salamander (who is not only larger than the creature creating the effect, but also has their center of mass in a different area).

In these cases (where mass, weight or leverage), you may consider substituting the described saving throw (usually Agility) with Strength, with further advantageous circumstances also reflecting with advantage to the saving throw.

### Cleaving Through Creatures
**Source: Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 272**
___
If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help speed up such fights.

When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.

### Withdrawal
Arcane magic is known to be addictive--and tapping into vast energies more than once and losing it afterwards causes severe mental and physical stress. High elves after the fall of Quel’thalas are particularly susceptible to arcane withdrawal.

If cursed with this dreadful affliction, one must meditate for thirty minutes every day (this does not contribute to short rests), or else suffer disadvantage to their saving throws versus magic, and reduce their maximum mana pool by 1 point. If the spell has an attack roll, it has advantage against the character.

Meditation requires a Spirit score of 11 or higher to automatically succeed, or a successful DC 10 Spirit saving throw at the end of the meditation period.

Drawing mana and restoring it actively (such as drinking from mana fountains, potions of any type that contain arcane spells, and mana siphoning) restores the addict’s maximum mana pool of any penalties, and suspends withdrawal for a number of days equal to their Stamina modifier.

If one’s maximum mana is reduced to 0 from this effect, they typically transform into mindless mana addicts, relentlessly seeking out mana fountains and similar restorative effects (such as potions), viciously savaging anyone who seeks to take away their light (and are derogatorily known as mana junkies or wretches).

Addiction to fel magic can also be represented by this rule.

\pagebreakNum

# Chapter 10: Spellcasting
Whether it comes in the form of a healer’s gentle touch or the wrath of a warlock’s fiery rain, magic is a way of life in Azeroth. For good or evil, magic has infiltrated the world and shows no sign of leaving. The dark siren call of the arcane and the gentle but firm tapping of divine energies both color the world and affect its inhabitants. The way of magic is often a dangerous road to travel, yet most set out confidently on a journey that they do not expect to end in doom.

The path of the arcane magic user is dark and questionable. Arcane power is undeniably the strongest magic branch; arcanists can command elements, monsters and even undead with their power. It was the use of these powers, however, that attracted the most destructive forces to Azeroth — not once, but many times in the past ten thousand years. Even with history proving time and again that arcane use leads to damnation, there is no lack of arrogant new arcanists on Azeroth who believe that they can control the forces at work. Arcane magic users are usually high elves and humans. Demons are the masters of the arcane, and the Lich King and his Scourge spellcasters are also talented.

The path of the divine is less fraught with paradox and doom. Arcane casters call it the weaker path, while divine casters calmly state that it is the subtler of the two. Focused on support magic and healing, adherents of the divine can also call down the destructive forces of nature. Divine practitioners are usually orcs, tauren or night elves. Ironforge dwarves and humans also have their divine magic users.
This chapter introduces the mana system, and the mechanics that facilitate its function.

## Spellcasting Ability
Depending on the character’s class or race, they may gain spellcasting abilities (also known as a caster level). Spellcasting can either be arcane (drawn from studying esoterica, complex ley patterns, and ancient tomes and runes) or divine (drawn from revering and being granted powers from powerful entities, such as the Elven goddess Elune, the Holy Light, the Unholy Shadow, or the Lich King).

Regardless of source, merely gaining spellcasting capabilities grants the character the ability to cast spells and maintain a mana pool to fuel their powers. The spellcaster needs to have spells readied and prepared, and also requires the mana necessary to fuel them.

The character’s caster level is different from (but is affected by) their character level and hit dice, and determines access to new spell levels (representing mastery of magic), while the spellcaster’s proficiency bonus determines the cost of magic spells and mana pool size (which represents their practical training).

## Known and Prepared Spells
The caster level of the spellcaster is determined by the ability that grants spellcasting. Mages gain 1 caster level for every level in the mage class, while paladins gain half the normal rate. A spellcaster can only prepare spells if their caster level is 1 or higher. The below table shows the spell level accessed by caster level.

Unlike with normal fractions, caster levels are rounded up at the point they are gained.

For example, the hunter’s spellcasting is at 0.5 a caster level per level in hunter, but gain the Spellcasting feature at level 2 (preventing spellcasting to be done at level 1). A level 10 mage and level 10 hunter have caster levels of 10 and 5, respectively, allowing the mage can access 5th level spells, and the hunter to access 3rd level spells.

Merely having a high enough caster level is not enough to begin casting, however; a character must also prepare and access the relevant spell.

### Prepared and Known Spells
A character can prepare a total number of spells equal to their caster level plus their spellcasting attribute modifier. These spells can be of any spell level the character can access and cast (being of the required caster level and spell list).

Some class abilities grant extra spells to the total. These are often described as ‘you always have this spell prepared’. These can exceed the normal limit of prepared and known spells.

### Heightening Spells
A caster may cast a lower-level spell with additional mana as if it were a few spell levels higher. This is termed heightening. Spells that can be heightened gain various effects when they are heightened at specific spell levels. This can only be done if the caster level of the spellcaster is high enough to heighten the spell to said level.

A character can always heighten a spell. In most cases, the difference between one spell level and one higher is 1 mana point.

| Caster Level | Spell Level Accessed |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 1 (and cantrips if specified by class) |
| 3 | 2 |
| 5 | 3 |
| 7 | 4 |
| 9 | 5 |
| 11 | 6 |
| 13 | 7 |
| 15 | 8 |
| 17 | 9 |

### Spellbooks
Spellbooks are a collection of scrolls, a book, or objects that contain the method of casting a spell, such as magic words, name of the forces invoked, and required hand gestures.

Unlike in other campaign settings, all spellcasters in the Warcraft universe require some form of spellbook or external house of their spells. Spellbooks are important objects for spellcasters, therefore, and are often traded among trusted members of the same profession.

For example, a shaman completing his apprenticeship will be given a master totem (which acts as a spellbook) thatdescribes how invoking the elements may be done and

\pagebreakNum

containing several basic spells, while a mage graduate from Dalaran’s magical universities will have already scribed a spellbook over the course of her study. A spellbook can be a gift from a dying friend or loved one, or valuable loot taken from a rival or enemy on the field of battle.

When a spellcaster finds a spell that is present their class’s spell list that they can cast (having the required level), they may spend the required time and resources to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the spellcaster who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp (or 2 Infusion Points per level). The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, which can be anything from fine inks (for a mage) to sacrificing rare reagents (for a shaman or druid), or costly incense (for a paladin). Cantrips count as half a spell level, or 1 hour and 25 gp to scribe.

Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells, and the spell is fully scribed in your spellbook.

Replacing the Book. A spellcaster can copy a spell from one spellbook to another—for example, if they wish to back up their spellbook or grant one to a student. This does not require deciphering. It takes only 1 hour and 10 gp per spell level to copy the spell (or 30 minutes and 5 gp for a cantrip).

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many spellcasters keep backup spellbooks in a safe place, or even scribe their spells onto their strongholds—chapels of the Holy Light often have basic priest and paladin spells scribed onto the stone walls or woven into prayer books, while the druids of Ashenvale may visit the Ancients to be blessed with an idol of the Ancients that performs a similar task.

After preparing a spell, referring to a spellbook is not required except to change the spell.

| Class | Spellbook (or equivalent) |
|:-:|:-:|
| Alchemist | Formula Book |
| Death Knight | Runeblade |
| Druid | Idol |
| Hunter | Idol (as druid), totem (if shadow hunter) |
| Mage | Spellbook |
| Paladin | Libram |
| Priest | Libram |
| Rogue | Spellbook (if subtlety), spell tattoos (if demon hunter) |
| Shaman | Totem (often known as a master totem) |
| Warlock | Grimoire |
| Warrior | Spellbook (if spellbreaker), spell tattoos (if mountain king) |
___
Special spellbooks exist, also known as Relics. See Treasures under Chapter 5: Equipment.

#### Variant Spellbook: Spell Tattoos
A character may tattoo spells onto their skins, scales, or clothes to hold their spells besides normal spellbooks. This costs the same as normal scribed spells, and the creature's body is treated to be the spellbook. However, whenever the creature fails a death saving throw, one tattooed spell has a 25% chance to be destroyed (the chance increases by 50% if the damage scars, such as acid, fire, or fel damage).

A medium character can scribe up to 50 pages worth onto their skin (such as chest, arms, legs, etc.). For smaller creatures, the pages are halved, and for larger creatures, the pages are doubled.

A known spell-tattooist is the demon hunter Illidan Stormrage, although many demon hunters also scribe spells onto their skin.

### Spells Prepared
A spellcaster may ready any spell they can access (and have the required minimum caster level). This requires being tutored, praying for a spell, studying one, or finding spells in scrolls or spellbooks. A spellcaster may always use a spellbook they find, or scribe the spell from a spellbook they don’t own to a spellbook they do own. If a class has access to cantrips, they can also change their cantrips (taking the same process to change spells). The character is limited to the number of cantrips equal to their proficiency bonus.

There are several ways to gain access to and ready spells.
___
**1st level:** The first level of any spellcasting class instantaneously grants a number of readied spells, such as by gaining a grimoire, spellbook, libram (holy spellbook) etc.
___
**Leveling Up:** When leveling up, the spellcaster gains 2 spells of any spell level they can cast. They are treated as if they have spent their pastime performing research (see below or Discovery on chapter 4).
___
**Scribing a Spell:** Drawing new runes with rare inks, carving a dedication on a shaman totem, or reproducing a spell in a mage’s spellbook or scroll into another one all require acute understanding of spellcasting, time, and materials. This is described in more detail above under Spellbooks.
___
**Research:** A character can research and create their own spell (effectively preparing a spell in their spell lists they could not find yet) by spending downtime in research and the cost of scribing the spell. This works exactly as the discovery downtime activity (see chapter 7).
___
**Tutelage:** Spellcasters may gain spells directly from other spellcasters or magical beings such as celestials, fey, demons, undead, or monstrosities. Tutelage costs the same as scribing a new spell, but is often be done for free in return for a service or fulfilling a quest, with the creature scribing the spellcaster’s spell for no cost. Druids, shamans, and warlocks usually resort to being tutored by powerful beings (such as Cenarius taught Malfurion Stormrage, the elementals taught Thrall, and demonic cults teach warlocks) in exchange for services (usually related to defeating their enemies or reducing their influence). A spellcaster naturally knows their tutor’s name, but in most cases they are insufficiently powerful to conjure it.
___
**Lore:** Easy Way to Power. The primary reason why walking the path of the warlock is considered the ‘easy and corrupt way’ to power has to do with gaining spells. Mages don’t have tutors who are naturally-attuned to the arcane, and must go through the works of studying and reading

\pagebreakNum

spellbooks, which is a controlled and difficult environment usually plagued by academic competition and rivalries.

On the other hand, the Burning Legion’s emissaries (from imps to dreadlords) all find the process of tutoring a win-win situation; by tutoring and asking for services in exchange, they both increase the power of their agent (the warlock himself) and further their own objectives (spreading destruction, the Legion’s influence, and character change in making the warlock more suspected by their peers, tying them to the Legion and away from their community so that redemption is more difficult).

This is similar to the Holy Light, Forgotten Shadow, and the Ancients’ approach to tutelage of priests, paladins, and druids; except that these forces are normally reluctant to dole out spells and power unless the student has proven themselves worthy or loyal enough to the ideology or cause.

Some spells, such as holy light, divine shield, and revivify (for paladins); create food and water and teleport (for mages); elemental shock and astral recall (for shamans) may be offered for free in exchange for class quests, and are not commonly traded among equals of the relevant profession.

Subject to DM adjudication, these spells cannot be gained by other methods (such as being researched, chosen at 1st level, or gained when leveling up).

It is advised that a DM employing this rule clarify their stance regarding iconic spells before the game starts.

## The Mana System
When gaining spellcasting ability, the character also gains a pool of mana points equal to their two times their spellcasting ability score (Intelligence for mages, charisma for paladins, etc.) plus their caster level. For instance, a Mage with 16 Intelligence and caster level of 5 has a mana pool of 37 (two times the ability score + 5 caster level).

Mana is spent on casting spells, and spells fail when the mana pool doesn’t have enough mana for the spell (unless the spell itself costs 0 mana).

### Mana Cost of Spells
The higher the spellcaster’s skill in wielding magic, the more efficient they can fuel their spells with mana. The cost is 16 mana points for the caster’s highest level spell. For each spell level below the highest, the mana cost is reduced by 3, to a minimum equal to the spell’s level. When you cast a spell of 7th, 8th, or 9th level, you cannot cast it again until after a short rest, regardless of how many mana you have in reserve. Cantrips do not cost mana.

Some abilities reduce the mana cost of spells below the listed mana cost, to a minimum stated in the ability. In all cases and with no exceptions, spells that restore hit points are never reduced below 1 mana point.

Mana Cost Table: Caster Level and Spell Level

</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Less-than-Full Casters
If your caster level is not equal to your character level, as the case with paladins, subtlety rogues, or hunters, refer to the table above as normal appropriate to their caster level.

### Favored Spells
Some spellcasters are particularly skilled in casting certain spell. Favored spells cost 2 less mana points (minimum 0). Some abilities and items grant favored spells when used.

## Regaining Mana Points
A character regains spent mana through the following passive and active regeneration methods:
___
**Invocations.** Abilities of powerful spellcasting classes such as Invocation for mages, Ancient Power for druids, and Desperate Prayer for priests all restore mana. Unless otherwise stated, a character can only use mana restorative abilities once every hour (such as a drink from mana fountain).
___
**Rest.** A character regains a number of mana points equal to spellcasting ability modifier for every hour in which they have not cast spells, or every per short rest. A character regains all spent mana points after a full night’s rest.
___
**Epic Heroism.** If you are using the Epic Heroism rest variant, you regain mana every 5 minutes, and regain all spent mana points after 1 hour’s rest. Consider restricting spellcasters so that only a full 8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to regain access to spent 7th to 9th level spells.
___
**Gritty Realism.** If you are using the Gritty Realism rest variant, you regain mana every 4 hours in which you have not cast spells.
___
Around the world lie areas of power: ley lines intersect and react with water, creating moonwells, mana fountains, and similar fonts of power. Those who rest near a lay line intersection or such feature increase their mana regeneration per hour when within 30 feet of the source by 50% (round down, minimum +1 mana point). An example of a mana fountain is the high elves’ Sunwell in Quel’Thalas (which, unlike normal mana fountains, grants the benefits within the city of Silvermoon, and not just when in proximity), and the night elves’ Moonwells.
___
**Mana Tap.** You may tap into reserves of magic, such as drinking from a mana potion, drawing from a lay line-infused font of power (such as a drinking from a mana fountain or bathing in a moonwell), or special spells. This requires an action, and restores mana as if you rested for one hour (using the normal rest rules, 5 minutes for epic heroism, and 4 hours for gritty realism) or the amount listed in the source’s description (such as with the Warlock’s life tap spell).
___
**Mana Siphoning.** Also known as vampirism, mana siphoning is an obscure and often frowned-upon variant of mana tap. Drawing from a living source of mana instead of an object or location, you may siphon mana from another creature by touching them (with hands, fingers, or even by a kiss) and draining out their mana. For each action, this restores the same amount of mana as if you conducted a mana tap, and deducts double the amount of mana points from the target so long as they have mana to give.

The target must be helpless, willing, or dead for no more than 1 hour. If the creature is helpless (asleep, paralyzed, etc.) but neither dead nor willing, they is entitled a Stamina saving throw contested to the drinker’s Stamina saving throw to resist. When siphoned once, a creature cannot be siphoned again for 24 hours. If done to an unwilling, dead, or particularly powerful or charismatic target, vampirism could have a hidden and corruptive influence on the feeder (such as inflicting an arcane disease, leaving a mark, causing an addiction to continue vampirism, or even embed a shard of the target’s personality in you).

Fiends such as demons always have active mana pools, using their highest mental ability score (even if they do not have caster levels). Creatures that do not have mana (or do not use them) are normally immune to the effects of such spells. Siphoning mana from fiends via vampirism usually causes the influence of Fel magic to appear on the target (causing green to invade the character’s coloration in skin, eye color, or even blood), and causing them to be more receptive to demonic influences (can take any form).

## Special Rules
### Calling, Conjuring, and Binding
The Warcraft universe has many historical instances of calling out to a creature, conjuring it, and then binding it to servitude.

Druids of Ashenvale can call out to creatures they heard of but never witnessed to speak with them and learn their secrets (allowing them to Wild Shape into them), while hunters may call out to beasts native to their region to bind them for temporary service before releasing them back into the wilds.

Failed mages of harsh masters or teachers may succumb to the temptation of calling an imp or similar demonic force that can teach them a spell they must learn (accepting tutoring instead of having to do exhausting research), and established warlocks can conjure and bind said creatures to deliver them information about such students to further drive them into dark magic.

Paladins and priests of the holy light might attempt to call out to greater forces than the ones in Azeroth, such as the Naaru or other angelic and celestial creatures, or be called by them in turn for an urgent quest delivered in a dream.

In all such cases, calling a creature is a critical mechanic in the Warcraft universe that has driven many events. If not for Gul’dan answering the Legion’s call, he might have never developed as warlock, and employed his fel might to corrupt the orcs. Also, if not for humans hearing the call of the Naaru, they might have never known the Holy Light.

#### Call
##### Mechanic
You can send out a mental plea, message, or beseech a creature that can listen, even if not on your plane. The DM can either roll on the following table to determine the power that heard your call, or can choose one power from the same list that is interested in your call.

The power receives a shard of your name, and gains the Call Link action (see below), and can use it upon you.

\pagebreakNum

##### Call Link
**You call upon**
___
Upon establishing the connection, each party receives a shard of the other party’s full name. This does not require the ability to cast spells, but does require a skill check (chosen by the power, and DC set by the DM, depending on the strength of the power that chooses to answer). Commonly, a servitor’s name is sent instead of the power itself, in which case they hear the call and the request.

Depending on the nature of your plea, it can be heard clearer by one power than by others. For instance, requests for power might be heard by the Old Gods or the Burning Legion, while requests for aid might be heard of more benign powers such as the Wild Gods or the Holy Light. Sometimes, a call can be intercepted by a third party, such as a demon hunter hearing a budding warlock’s call to the Burning Legion.

| d10 | Power | Servitor |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Burning Legion | Warlocks, demons, cultists, chaotic evil undead |
| 2 | Dragon aspects | Dragons, aligned mages, cultists of the dragon |
| 3 | Order | Titans, remaining servitors (titanic observers, watchers) |
| 4 | Holy Light | Naaru, celestials, holy priests, paladins |
| 5 | Lich King<sup>1</sup> | Death knights, death priests, lawful evil undead, cultists of the damned |
| 6 | Spirits<sup>2</sup> | Shamans, neutral or good elementals, neutral or good ghosts, spirit beings |
| 7 | Void (Shadow) | Old Gods, shadow priests, void beings, aberrations (forgotten ones), evil elementals |
| 8 | Voodoo/Loa | The Loa, some druids and priests, shadow hunters, witch doctors |
| 9 | Wild Gods<sup>3</sup> | Druids, beasts, fey, some shamans |
| 10 | Roll again | If the result is another 10, the power that contacts you is a possible version of you from a parallel universe or timeline. |
___
**1** This can represent other death gods in the case of the Lich King’s destruction or weakening, such as certain Loa (Bwonsamdi and Lukou)
___
**2** This can represent anything from ancestral ghosts or restless spirits in your area, your own ancestors, elemental spirits, or beings from the Shadowlands
___
**3** This includes the Elune, the Moon Goddess, beings from the Emerald Dream, or other natural powers.
___
If you have part of a creature’s name, you can invite a projection of them to meet you in your native realm or affect them with the bind spell, so long as the creature type is of one in your class list (see Conjuring and Binding under your class).

The projection can choose to answer or reject your call, depending on what you wish from it or offer it. You may deceive the creature by calling it for a different reason, but projections can also deceive you, and claim to serve powers they in reality oppose.

Usually, this depends on your reputation, and deceptive practitioners of this ability usually find their calls rejected or answered by similarly deceptive forces.

The projection, upon accepting the invitation into your realm, is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way, and may choose to appear in a form unlike its true one. The projection is an intangible magical impression of the creature, and has none of their capabilities (spellcasting, hit points), except that it can move at a fly speed of 30 feet per round and can hover, and can appear as whatever form it wishes. It can speak any language it can, but only you can hear it. It appears within 90 feet of you, and cannot move further away or contact another creature than you.

The projection remains until you choose to dismiss it, which requires a successful Charisma saving throw against a DC of 10. If the creature wishes to resist being dismissed, the DC is 8 + the creature’s Proficiency bonus + the creature’s Charisma modifier.

You may repeat this saving throw once per round, but if you fail three times, the impression is not bound stay close to you, and can attempt to contact another being (such as by Calling it in turn until the connection is established). Such actions are usually taken by chaotic beings or ones who believe they have unfinished business (such as spirits and ghosts) or beings that expect (or can sense) spellcasters nearby that can conjure and bind them.

##### Extraplanar Binding Rules
Performing extraplanar binding is a difficult task that requires many steps, but can be rewarding.
___
First, you must know the name of the creature you wish to bind. This can be gained by learning it from a teacher, reading it in a book, or calling out to a creature (although the risk with lying projections usually deters rash conjurations). You do not necessarily know the name of a creature you conjure with the conjure spell. True names (see below) are stronger versions of the creature’s normal name.
___
Second, you must prepare the conjure spell to conjure the specific creature you named.
___
Third, you must prepare the bind spell to bind the specific creature you need. You may conjure the creature into an inverted magic circle spell to keep it from causing chaos or leaving the bind spell’s range while you cast the bind spell.
___
Fourth, you must cast the bind spell, and the target must fail their saving throw.
___
Fifth, you must negotiate terms of binding, such as servitude for a time or task, and pay the cost of the binding. You may alternatively choose to release it, in which case it can act freely until dismissed by other means (such as the exorcism or banishment spells, being killed, being charmed or commanded to return to their own realm, or being bound by another caster and then dismissed).
___
If you are successful, the creature is bound to you for the duration of its task (if it was given a task).

#### Oaths and Blood Oaths
Oaths and Blood oaths are pledges of undying loyalty and faithfulness that are spoken before a representative of the spirits or a divine (such as most priests and paladins). It is easy to take an oath, but its true strength applies only if the oath-giver is true in the oath.

\pagebreakNum

If pledging to a cause, the oath-giver and all their comrades are linked by deep magics. Shamans (restoration shamans specifically) can enhance certain abilities of fellow oath-sworn.

Willingly breaking an oath after giving it in truth may cause the oath-giver to be cursed as per the bestow curse spell. The detect thoughts spell may reveal an oath given by a character.

If compelled to go against their oath, the oath-giver can gain advantage to one d20 roll to avoid breaking it. This can be used once per short rest.

#### True Names
All that is has a true name; a name that can compass what the object or creature is, and describe it to the fullest picture. Hence, a demon has a true name, so does a ship. In most cases, learning a true name is a practice in study and reflection of the thing’s nature and role in life (or in the afterlife).

Learning a true name is a task that requires at least 30 days of downtime in research per point of CR for regular creatures.

Particularly social creatures are easier to learn (taking half as much), and reclusive ones may require research at a particular facility or using specific books (as determined by the DM) at double the research rate. For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp plus your normal living expenses.

After obtaining the name, it can be written down as normal text. Knowledge of how it is pronounced is not tied to reading the name; it can be properly pronounced by those who have heard it aloud, researched it, or have read it with perfect accent (such as using linguistic tools as umlauts)

These abilities require speaking the name of the creature verbally. It needn’t be shouted, but even whispers can be listened in with a successful Spirit (Perception) check contested by your Charisma (Performance) check. Allowing a creature to learn the true name of a favored summoned ally is a dangerous proposition, as enemy conjurers would love to compel your allies to turn against you; if they are conjured, they have no choice.

##### Using a true name grants several benefits:
You may conjure a creature you conjure with the conjure spell with a stronger bond; the creature gains temporary hit points upon being conjured equal double its Challenge Rating. This also applies to creatures that are affected by the bind spell.

You may impose upon a creature disadvantage to saving throws against spells you target it with.

You gain the benefits of the sanctuary spell against the creature (and it alone) for 24 hours. The spell acts at a spell level equal to half the target’s CR (minimum 1, maximum 9). The DC is equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).

You can reduce one of the creature’s damage immunities into damage resistance, or remove one of the creature’s damage resistances. This can stack with similar features (such as the Black Fire feature). Only your abilities and spells can affect the creature this way.

You can remove one type of condition immunity from the target. With this ability, you can cause skeleton to be poisoned by your poisons, or frighten a construct, etc. Only your abilities and spells can affect the creature this way.

A creature’s true name can change if their inherit nature transforms, such as them undergoing character development, leveling up, undergoing a trial, or by casting the mind blank spell on them. The latter method can weaken the connection between a creature and its true name, but cannot fully change a creature’s nature unless it is cast on a creature in a moment of reflection.

Fiends and celestials are more resistant to changing their true name; such would require a grand quest where the creature’s original mortal form must be rediscovered. With constructs, changing a true name is invariably linked to the spirit of its creator and their feelings upon crafting, who is a required reference.

A creature can be affected by their true name by one user at a time and only one effect; if two or more creatures attempt to use one creature’s true name, they must contest against one another with a Charisma (Persuasion, Intimidation, or Performance) check to determine who has the greater command over this mighty magic.

## Casting a Spell
Spellcasting may be interrupted if the spellcaster is harmed while casting or channeling the spell (such as channeling or stance spells, or when struck with a held action). This is called a distraction.

When hit this way, the spellcaster must succeed on a concentration check (Stamina saving throw), DC 10 or half the damage dealt (whichever is higher) or the spell fails (and the mana is spent uselessly).

This acts similarly to casting spells in situations that are difficult to cast spells in (such as while on being a storm-tossed ship or while being distracted by wind and rain).

### Concentration
Some spells require a lesser degree of concentration than normal. These spells are described as Concentration (Partial) spells.

Spells with this duration allow you to concentrate on the spell itself and another concentration spell at the same time, including another Concentration (Partial) spell.

### Mana-Less Casting
Resilient spellcasters can cast magic on nothing, channeling the mana around them instead of their own. Attempting to cast a spell without sufficient mana points left (or attempting to cast a spell without spending mana at all) requires a Stamina saving throw to cast a spell. The DC is equal to 20 + spell level. You take a penalty to the saving throw equal to half the amount of mana below 0.

If successful, the spell is cast, but count the mana cost against the current pool (this can reach a negative value, increasing the DC). On a failure, the spellcaster suffers one level of exhaustion. This level of exhaustion is only lifted when the spellcaster is at full mana points.

### Multiclassing
Multiclassing in the World of Warcraft 5e RPG is similar to its state in 5e; you add your levels in spellcasting together to determine your total caster level (0.5 for each level in Paladin, 1 for each level in Priest, etc.) to learn your maximum spell level. You may also make use of both spell lists, but only to the maximum spell level you can access in either lists (a level 1 Mage and level 10 Paladin cannot cast 3rd level mage spells). The mana is drawn from a single pool.

\pagebreakNum

You also refer your proficiency bonus when addressing mana costs, and not your caster level.

# Chapter 11 - Spells

This chapter describes the most common spells in the worlds Warcraft. The chapter begins with the spell lists of the spellcasting classes. The remainder contains spell descriptions, presented in alphabetical order by the name of the spell.

Some classes have specific names for a spell. These names are italicized next to the normal spell name.

Spells can be cast by any character who has access to mana and a spell list. Whenever a class references being able to cast spells from a specific spell list, refer to the below list under the appropriate name.
___
**Array.** Spells with the array tag have several sub-spells. When preparing a spell with the array tag, you must choose to prepare one spell of the array (each of which may have their own spell levels and different effects). Some arrays give circumstantial access to other spells. In this case, heightening the spell in the array count as if heightening that spell. Array spells that manifest a strike or shot effect enhance a number of attacks as appropriate to their description.
___
**Auras.** Spells with the aura tag are spells that emit an aura centered on the character, usually reaching 15 feet away, typically remaining for a few minutes, and moving with the user. Auras do not require concentration, but a character can only benefit from one aura at any given time (their choice), and auras can usually counter other ones. If subject to harmful auras, the character is subject to all they fail to resist (as normal for spells), rolled upon entering the aura or being affected by it.  Aura bonuses do not stack with other aura bonuses. Creatures affected by auras automatically sense where they are emanating from.
___
**Aura Spike.** An aura spike is the ability to focus an aura’s power to perform a secondary effect. This is useable on a reaction. You can make one aura spike per every two spell levels of a given aura spell.
___
**Blessings.** This array includes beneficial spells that are activated by consuming half your movement, and may target yourself or an ally. A creature can have only one blessing active on them at any given time, with most blessings’ duration being five minutes.
___
**Channel.** These spells are most demanding concentration spells, and require the investment of one action every round to maintain the spell. If the caster cannot invest the required actions, the spell ends. Above the required action, the spellcaster cannot move faster than half their speed. As for all concentration spells, this spell is broken if concentration is lost.
___
**Sigil.** These are spells that have an initial direct effect (and a diminished effect on a miss). After the primary effect, the sigil re-inflicts the primary effect every round (called a sigil ‘pulse’). A sigil pulses at the start of the caster’s turn every round for the spell’s duration. Sigil effects end when its duration ends or if the target is reaches full hit points (if a healing sigil) or 0 hit points (healing spells and other spells). Some sigils have a special effect that only trigger when they end naturally, or when their target is reduced to 0 hit points.
___
**Seals.** These are personal spells (with a target of ‘you’) that are also cast as part of your movement (consumes base half movement, cannot be used if already spent). A creature may be under the effects of one seal at any given time, and most seals have a duration of one minute. Seals may be released (termed judgment or release), and impose the additional effect specified under the spell. These are considered beneficial spells. Only paladins may cast seals. Death Knights may cast seals, but only those marked as runic spells.
___
**Strike.** Strike spells modify a successful attack. See Chapter 9 for more details on strike effects. Strike and shot effects also usually a potential number of attacks equal to double the spell level.

For instance, using kill shot as a 2nd level spell enhances 4 ranged attacks. The caster can have multiple potential strikes active, but cannot apply two shot or strike abilities to the same attack unless otherwise specified.
___
**Stances.** Stance spells modify several features, usually involving movement. See Chapter 9 for more details on stance effects.
___
**Totems.** Totems are spells that are imbued with power from the caster, and are set on a spot within range. Totems usually remain for one minute, and require a reaction to activate each round, casting a specific spell.

Totems have 7 AC, and hit points equal to double the level of the caster. Totems occupy space as if an object one size category smaller than their caster. Destroying a totem by reducing it to 0 hit points deactivates the effect and dispels the spell as normal. Whenever the totem is subjected to a saving throw, they use the caster’s bonus. They can be moved with a bonus action and a gesture, moving a distance equal to the caster’s speed.

Also, when heightening a totem based on another spell (such as an elemental shock totem, based on the elemental shock spell), heightening the totem acts as if heightening the spell for the same number of spell levels.
___
Superscripted is the source of the spell if it is not from the Player’s Handbook.
___
**EE** = Elemental Evil
___
**XGtE** = Xanthar’s Guide to Everything
____
**WoW5eRPG** = World of Warcraft 5e RPG
___
**UA** = Unearthed Arcana

## Spell Descriptions

#### Abandonment Aura [level 1]
*Abjuration [aura]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**  1 hour
___
Destructive energy radiates from you in an aura with a 15-foot radius centered on you. Each hostile creature that is in the spell’s area who who loses at least 1 hit point from a weapon attack made by you or one of your allies suffers 2 additional points of damage.

A creature in the aura can negate this effect if they succeed on a Spirit saving throw once within the aura’s area.

This spell is suppressed by the protection from good and evil (and similar abjurations). This is an aura bonus.
___
**Heightened.** For each spell level above 1st, the extra damage increases by 1 point (up to 6 extra points of damage at spell level 5).
___
*Note.* This spell suppresses and is suppressed by the devotion aura spell.

#### Aligned Weapon [level 5]
*Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
___
You imbue a weapon you touch with power aligned to the Holy Light or the Forgotten Shadow. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, colored golden white (if Holy Light) or pale violet (if Forgotten Shadow). In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 extra damage on a hit (holy damage if Holy Light, or shadow damage if Forgotten Shadow). If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a lasting blast. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Stamina saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 damage (holy or shadow), and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Stamina saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
___
*Special.* If aligned to the Forgotten Shadow, the weapon may, at your will, shed no light instead. In that case, releasing the spell deals extra 1d8 shadow damage.

#### Amplify Magic [level 5]
*Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet (15-foot radius sphere)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.
___
You amplify magical effects in the area of effect. All spells cast from or into the area of effect are heightened one spell level. If the spell cannot be heightened (or if heightening has no effect), it heals 25% more, damages 25% more, or remains for 25% longer.

Dampen Magic This spell may be reversely cast. If so, the spells cast into or from the area of effect are counted one level lower (if eligible) and are reversely affected (heals 25% less, deals 25% less damage, or remains for 24% less time).

#### Ancestral Guardians [level 2]
*Abjuration [sigil] [healing]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch (one creature)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, plus 3 rounds
___
You conjure spirits to guard and advise the target in battle, tapping into the target's ancestral bonds. The target regains 2d4 hit points. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.

Also, so long as this sigil is active, the target also takes 1 less point of damage from weapon and spell attacks and effects for that round. The reduction to damage is an aura effect. If the caster and the target share ancestry or share a Blood Oath (see Chapter 10), the damage reduction increases by 1 point, and the spell automatically stabilizes the target if they are reduced to 0 hit points.

Constructs gain no benefit from this spell.
___
**Heightened.** The healing increases by one dice per every level above 2nd, and reduction to damage increases by one point per every two levels above 2nd.

#### Arcane Armor [level 1]
*Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Personal (Self)
- **Components:** V, S, M (Focus crystal that costs 10 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
A protective field guards you. Upon casting this spell, you may choose one magic school or energy type, and gain advantage to all saves versus that school or resistance versus that damage type for the duration of the spell.

You, however, gain disadvantage to saving throws that belong to spells that another school (see table below), or vulnerability to damage from its opposing type.

You cannot gain resistance to an effect you are already resistant to, but you can gain resistance to an effect you are vulnerable against (becoming neutral). You cannot gain vulnerability to an effect you are immune to.

| School | Opposing School |
|:-:|:-:|
| Abjuration | Evocation |
| Illusion | Divination |
| Conjuration | Transmutation |
| Enchantment | Necromancy |
| Energy Type | Opposing Type |
| Fire | Cold |
| Acid | Lightning or Thunder |
| Holy | Shadow or Fel |
___
*Special.* If you become vulnerable to a school, you gain disadvantage to saving throws, and attackers that affect you using that school or energy type have advantage to attacks against you.

\pagebreakNum

**Heightened.** When cast as a level 6 spell, you gain resistance to the damage type or advantage versus the school chosen without gaining vulnerability or disadvantage to the opposite type or school.

#### Arcane Barrage [level 4]
*Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet (10-foot-radius sphere)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You create two large glowing bursts of violet force, sending them to a single enemy within range. The bursts two intertwine, striking the enemy and dealing 6d8 + 6 points of arcane damage to the target, and creating a fantastic display of magical force.

The blast explodes outward from the target in a 10-foot radius, affecting other creatures. Each creature in the 10-foot-radius area besides the initial target takes the same damage described above on a failed Agility save, and is pushed 5 feet away from the center of the blast (or the initial target). They take only half as much damage and are not pushed on a successful saving throw.
___
**Heightened.** The spell deals an extra 1d8+1 damage per every level above level 4.

#### Arcane Explosion [level 2]
*Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You expel a tremendous burst of arcane energy. Each creature and unattended object within 10 feet of you must make a Agility saving throw. A creature takes 2d4 + 2 arcane damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone.
___
**Heightened.** The spell deals an extra 1d4+1 damage per every level above level 2.

#### Arcane Orb [level 5]
*Evocation [totem]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
___
You create a swirling orb of magical force that periodically expels arcane energy. When you cast this orb, you may use a reaction for it to emit an arcane explosion centered on the orb itself, as the spell arcane explosion.

#### Aspect Array [level 1+]
*Transmutation [array]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Personal (Self)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes or special
___
You adopt yourself to an aspect of a beast or a terrain, deriving power from your bond with the land or the spirits that reside there. You must recognize the creature or terrain (or a comparable one) to adopt their aspect.

You gain one aspect from the below array.
* **Cheetah (level 1).** As the expeditious retreat spell
* **Desolate Terrain (level 1).** You have advantage against travel hazards, and against exhaustion from forced marches, starvation, and thirst. Instead of concentration up to 10 minutes, the duration of this aspect is 4 hours (does not require concentration, but cannot have another aspect).
* **Monkey (level 1).** You gain climb speed equal to one-half your normal speed.
* **Mountain Terrain (level 1).** You're acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. Instead of concentration up to 10 minutes, the duration of this aspect is 4 hours (does not require concentration, but cannot have another aspect).
* **Rejuvenating Woods (level 1).** You can roll twice for any healing dice to heal yourself if you are under the effects of a sigil spell.
* **Shark (level 1).** You gain swim speed equal to one-half your normal speed.
* **Terrain Adaption (level 1).** As the arcane armor spell (resists one energy damage, vulnerable to another). This covers volcanoes (fire/cold), frozen poles (cold/fire), storm plains (lightning/acid), and corrosive swamps (acid/lightning). This can be heightened as normal for arcane armor, but can only cover elemental damage.
* **Chameleon (level 2).** As the blur spell
  Eagle (level 2). You and one beast companion you have may score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20
* **Hawk (level 2).** Ranged attacks at long range do not impose disadvantage on your attack roll, and you reduce cover one grade (from half-cover to none, three-quarters to half-cover. This cannot reduce full cover)
* **Lion (level 2).** Whenever you and one ally stand in opposing sides from a target, both of you have advantage to attack rolls against them.
* **Turtle (level 3).** Whenever you take the Dodge action, you also gain resistance to all weapon damage. If the target has disadvantage to attacking you from the Dodge action and fails to hit you with both rolls (one from the attack, and another from the disadvantage), you may make an attack of opportunity against them.
___
**Heightened.** For every spell level above the chosen aspect’s level, you may grant the benefits to two allies.

For example, heightening the Cheetah aspect to 3rd level allows you to grant the bonus to up to 4 allies (often called Aspect of the Cheetah Pack).

#### Avatar Form [level 3]
*Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Personal (Self)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
___
You invoke great powers to shroud your form in pure magic. Depending on your spellcasting class, you become attuned to different powers, granting you an array of abilities. While in this form, you gain the following abilities based on your spellcasting class:

You speak one language (if you don’t already speak it),

\pagebreakNum

You gain resistance to one damage type, and advantage to your next saving throw. If you are already affected by an effect that allows a saving throw, you may repeat the saving throw upon casting the spell to end the effect. This is not retroactive, but can end ongoing effects,

You gain the Mystic Blast feat (damage type determined by the list), modified with the innate feature (does not require mana in reserve),

You add your spellcasting ability modifier to the total damage or healing you deal with your spells. This is applied once per spell (regardless of number of hits or strikes). If you can already apply it, you can apply it again. The extra damage must be the same type you are attuned to,

Lastly, if you are reduced to 0 hit points while in this form, you can choose to end the spell and spend 1 hit dice to heal yourself.
___
*Special.* Avatar form is a spell that acts differently depending on your class (if you have multiclassed, choose one form when preparing this spell). If you have access to one of the below spell lists, you count as being that class for this spell’s purpose (such as Demon Hunters and Warlocks).

| Class Spell List | Language | Attuned Damage Type<br> (archetype, if any) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Death Knight | Necril | Shadow |
| Paladin | Celestial | Holy |
| Priest<sup>1</sup> | Celestial<br>Necril<br>Shath’yar | Holy (holy)<br> Psychic (shadow)<br> Shadow (death) |
| Warlock | Eredun | Fel |

**1** The moon priesthood is dependent on the phase of the moon for attuned damage type (holy for full moon and psychic or shadow for new moon).

#### Banishment [level 2]
*Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
One fiend, celestial, bound, or conjured creature you target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you shunt them with abjuration magic to a transitory state, causing them to become ethereally unstable (becoming restrained, and gaining resistance to all damage). At the end of the duration (if you were able to concentrate for an entire minute), they are banished to their original plane of existence. The creature may attempt a Strength saving throw at the beginning of its turn every round to suppress the restrained condition for 1 round.
___
**Heightened.** If heightened to level 4, you can target other creatures as well as fiends and celestials. For every spell level above 4th, you may also target one additional creature per spell level.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated instead of being ethereally unstable. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise (even if not a fiend, celestial, or bound), returning to its home plane once the saving throw fails. It is not fully sent back until 1 minute of passes with your concentration. If your concentration breaks before the minute passes, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.

#### Banshee’s Curse [level 3]
*Necromancy [sigil] [curse]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, plus 3 rounds
___
You suffuse the regretful curse of the banshee on a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d4 damage. The damage is half shadow, and half thunder. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.

Also, so long as the spell is active, the target must roll a d6 whenever they declare an action. On a result of a 2 or lower, the action fails. On a result of 3 or higher, the action takes place as normal. This effect cannot trigger more than once per round.

If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.
___
**Heightened.** The damage increases by one dice per every spell level above 3rd.

#### Barrier Ward [level 1]
*Abjuration [ritual]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small shield or glass lens)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
___
You create a barrier of magical force in a point within range that blocks and intercepts all attacks, damage, and spells that emit from the other side. The barrier appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of two 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side). The barrier can appear as anything you wish or any color, but is always semi-translucent. The barrier also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

The barrier has an Armor Class of 10, 10 hit points, and a Damage Threshold of 1 (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 246).
___
**Destroying the Ward.** Damage that exceeds the remaining hit points of the barrier break the barrier, and the excess damage can target any creature in the range of the original attack. Spells that do not deal damage are also blocked by the barrier. This damages the barrier by 2d6 damage per spell level on a successful attack casting (except cantrips, which have no effect unless they deal damage). If the ward does not have enough hit points to intercept the spell, the ward breaks and the spell takes effect normally.

\pagebreakNum

The barrier ward uses your own saving throw bonuses for the purposes of determining how many damage is dealt to it.
___
**Bypassing the Ward.** A creature adjacent to the barrier can spend 5 feet of movement and attempt to bypass it. If they succeed on a Spirit saving throw against the Spell Save DC, they can move through it and ignore it for the spell’s duration. A single character can try this once per spell.

The disintegrate spell automatically dissolves the ward, regardless of the remaining hit points it has, unless the barrier ward's spell level is higher than the disintegrate spell (in which case it affects the ward normally).
___
**Augmenting the Ward.** You may use a bonus action at the start of your turn or upon casting the spell to augment any active barriers. Whenever you attempt an augmentation, the ward also regains 5 (2d4) hit points per level of the barrier ward spell. All augmentations end at the start of your turn in the next round.
___
**Deepen.** Non-damaging spells deal 1d6 damage per spell level to the barrier instead of 2d6.
___
**Reflect.** The barrier deals damage when it is damaged. All creatures adjacent to the damaged side of the barrier suffer one-half the damage the barrier dealed. This requires a spell attack roll against the targets' Armor Class. This instantly destroys the barrier ward if it reflects damage and has less than half its original maximum hit points remaining.
___
**Strengthen.** The barrier has resistance against all damage types. This does not apply when absorbing non-damaging spells.
___
*Special.* When casting this spell, you may specify a certain creature type to be affected by the ward. In this case, you may apply one augmentation permanently to the barrier, but the barrier can only function against the specific creature type.

For example, a paladin casting barrier ward can specify undead, and make it automatically reflect damage dealt by undead creatures. Non-undead ignore the barrier entirely. The ward detects creature types by aura, and any deceptive magic or effect must succeed on a skill or spell attack roll against your Spell Save DC to deceive and negate the ward.
___
*Special.* If you ritually cast this spell, the duration increases to 1 hour. You can have up to 10 barrier wards raised this way, and one bonus action can apply one augmentation to all the wards. Ritual wards suffer double damage from all sources on the opposite side of the barrier. Such barriers must be drawn on a surface (such as with a piece of chalk or centered on a physical line). If the line is erased (for example, a creature that bypassed the ward uses an action to erase the line), the connected barrier ward ends when the line is erased.
___
**Heightened.** For every spell level above 1st, the barrier gains 10 additional hit points, and its Armor Class and the Damage Threshold increase by 1 each. If the ward is a wall, you also add two extra conjoined panels to its size per spell level. Special. By increasing the casting time to 1 minute, using a material component to draw a line (to set the barrier’s area on) and reducing the range to Touch, you can contain the barrier spell, increasing its duration to 1 hour. The seal or line automatically concentrates on resisting damage without your action, but is automatically dispelled if a creature spends a bonus action to disrupt the seal (such as by scattering the salt or wiping the chalk that formed the
___
circle). A creature that has failed to force its way against the ward cannot disrupt the seal.

#### Berserker Frenzy [level 2]
*Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a red napkin)
- **Duration:** Special, up to 1 minute
___
You cause one creature to go into a murderous rampage. The target must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or else gain the following features. A creature can choose to fail on the saving throw.

They gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

When they make a melee weapon attack using Strength, they gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. You may apply this twice per round.

They gain resistance to all weapon damage, reducing damage by no more than three times the spell level.

They suffer the Distracted condition (DC is equal to your spell DC).

The rage ends early if the target is knocked unconscious, or if their turn ends without being attacked or attacking a hostile creature, or if not taking at least one point of damage in that turn.

The benefits of this spell are not gained if the target is wearing heavy armor.

A creature affected by this spell makes another Stamina saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it. If the rage continues for more than two rounds, the creature gains one level of exhaustion at the end of the rage for 10 minutes for each round spent in rage. A creature can benefit from this spell a number of times equal to their proficiency bonus, replenishing on a rest.
___
**Heightened.** For each 3 spell levels heightened above 2nd level, the bonus to damage rolls increases by 1 (+3 at 5th, +4 at 8th).

#### Big Bad Voodoo [level 6]
*Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30-foot-radius sphere, centered on you
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You raise your hand and summon the strength of powerful Loa spirits. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on you, granting them 6d8 temporary hit points so long as the spell is active. Furthermore, the temporary hit points can also be spent to absorb spells (3 hit points per spell level).

If the shield manages to absorb all damage from an effect or absorb a spell, the warded creatures are protected against any secondary effects (as if immune). This can be determined after a saving throw.

The spell cannot be overwhelmed with one attack. If reduced to 0 temporary hit points with one attack, the spell ends with 1 hit point instead. This can occur only once for every instance of the spell being cast.

You cannot include yourself in this spell’s targets. You can channel this effect instead of merely concentrating, during which the shields regain 5 hit points per round of channeling. If you cannot maintain line of sight to a shielded ally, the effect fades from them (but returns should they

\pagebreakNum

return to your line of sight). A creature affected by this spell cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.
___
**Heightened.** For every spell level above 6th, the number of temporary hit points increases by 2d8.

#### Bind [level 1]
*Abjuration [ritual]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (bond payment, see below)
- **Duration:** Special (see below; 24 hour negotiation phase)
___
When you cast this spell, you can bind a creature of a type related to your spellcasting list (see Conjuring and Binding under your class). The creature's Challenge cannot exceed the spell's level.

The target of this spell must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it is compelled to negotiate with you by force of the spell, and cannot harm you or leave the spell's area until negotiations are concluded. If it succeeds, it is unbound (see below). If the bound creature was brought about by another spell (such as the conjure spell), it can be a valid target for this spell (the creature is still entitled a saving throw, although the creature must be within range for the entire casting time).
___
**Negotiation.** If the target fails their initial saving throw and enters negotiations, you and they debate terms. The negotiation phase remains up to 24 hours. You may re-cast the spell to maintain it another 24 hours, but a new saving throw is required every instance. If a creature that is conjured is placed in the bind spell's negotiation phase, its duration is extended until the bind spell ends (after which it disappears).

Negotiating with a creature that is affected by the bind spell but has not come to terms requires you to clarify the agreement conditions. This ranges from determining a task (such as casting a spell for you, stealing an object, or aid in a specific fight) to a continual task for a duration (protect me in combat for 1 week). Creatures that are bound expect payment, which is mandated by the terms agreed upon.
* **Task.** Upon completion of a task, the bond lessens, and the creature returns to its native realm (or to its original form) if conjured, or is left unrestrained (if found naturally). If you specified reporting back as part of its bond, its bind remains unless it reports to you the results of its task in a way it believes the news can reach you. The creature can wait until it is certain beyond reasonable doubt that you cannot (or will not) return, at which case it returns to its original realm (if it was originally conjured). If the task is indeterminable (such as helping you fight for an unspecified task), you must refer to the duration. Choosing a task requires payment (see below).
* **Duration.** If the creature is bound to serve for a specific pre-determined duration (such as 1 day, week, or a year and a day), it is automatically freed after the duration ends (as described above). Examples of a duration is guarding you for a time, providing council for a time, or providing a sustained service (such as scouting duties). Choosing a duration requires payment that is based on the task (see below).
___
**Active Binding.** Once negotiations conclude, the bound creature cannot disobey a direct order from you, or take actions against you or the task you have mandated. A bound creature shows recognizable signs of  being bonded to you,

either by a mark, tattoo, chains, bracers (or any form stated by you or determined by the setting—for instance, elementals of Warcraft usually bear binding bracers them). You can attempt to bind a creature already bound, which requires three contested spellcasting checks to break the first binding (or repel the attempt).
___
**Payment in Negotiation.** It is costly to establish a bond with a creature, and is usually the most common thing creatures require when bound. If bound for a task, the creature requires a material component equal in cost to 100 gp per point of Challenge Rating of the creature, which is consumed (if a consumable) or claimed (if not) by the creature. If bound for a duration, the target demands a percentage of its task price (depending on the duration, see below).

| Duration | Binding Cost |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1 day | 10% |  
| 1 week | 50% |  
| 1 month | 100% |  
| 1 year | 200% |
___
If it is unrestricted, or if the target requires a task or service instead, you do not need to provide payment, and the binding is in full force for the agreed upon duration and terms.  Payment can any form, such as valuable gems for an earth elemental, a relic of that cost for a celestial, or a necromantic crystal or onyx gems for undead.
___
**Friendly Creatures.** Creatures whose interests align with yours may halve or waive the payment entirely. The price of a non-hazardous task is also usually halved. The payment is also influenced by the place and circumstances of bonding (a blessed place might reduce the cost of binding a Celestial), while a horde of mindless undead may require only living sacrifices to serve. This is determined by the DM (negotiating for the other side).

You can have multiple bonded creatures, but no more than double your level at the same time. Excess creatures are automatically freed from their bonds, and may choose to return to their normal plane (of conjured) or become unrestricted. You are always aware of how tenuous your hold is on your bound creatures and whether a creature breaks free or not.
___
**Heightened.** The maximum Challenge of a possible bound creature is equal to the spell’s level.
___
*Special.* Depending on your relationship with the target, the bound creature may attempt to break free of the binding after it is successfully established (either by convincing you that it is in your best interests to make it unrestricted, offering to do more tasks in exchange for its freedom to remain in the realm, or conspiring to aid another force to hurt or blackmail you to release the spell). You can re-negotiate the terms of the binding by re-casting the spell so long as it hasn't ended yet. If the terms become more difficult, bonded creatures usually take this negatively, perverting your intent, twisting your words to achieve a different outcome, or similar mischief.
___
*Note.* This spell is also known as enslave undead or enslave demons (when used against existing undead and fiends, respectively), and Create Undead when used to bind permanent undead.

\pagebreakNum

#### Blessing Array [level 2+]
*Transmutation [array, blessing]*
___
- **Casting Time:** special (half movement)
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
___ 
You gain one blessing of the below array.
Blessing of Sacrifice (level 1). This potent blessing creates a spiritual connection between you and the subject. Each time the subject takes hit point damage, half of it transfers to you. If you and the subject move out of range of each other, the spell ends immediately. The halved damage is not counted as if resistance, but does not stack with it. The target and you must be within clear, unobstructed vision and within 15 feet of one another.
* **Blessing of Might (level 2).** You gain supernatural awareness of the vulnerabilities in your enemies. You gain +2 bonus to damage rolls. While under the benefits of this blessing, your pupils dilate, but are not any more sensitive to light than usual. This is an aura effect.
* **Blessing of Wisdom (level 2).** This powerful blessing aids spellcasters, aiding their mana expenditures in battle. For the duration of the blessing, the target’s spells cost one less mana point (minimum 1). This does not stack with other reductions, but can stack with Seal of Insight.
* **Blessing of Protection (level 3).** This potent blessing protects the target. The target gains the effect of a Divine Shield spell. However, the spell ends for the target if they attack or cast any spell.
* **Blessing of Kings (level 4).** You or any target creature gains +2 to all d20 rolls until the duration of the spell ends. This applies to attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
___
**Heightened.**
* **Blessing of Might.** For each level above 2nd, you add +1 to the damage roll increase, to a maximum of +5.

#### Blink Step [level 2]
*Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___ 
You shunt yourself dimensionally, teleporting yourself to an unoccupied spot in within 30 feet. You cannot teleport yourself to an area you cannot see, or into an object.

You may also teleport others with you, but each additional creature halves the distance remaining, and must be within touch range from you.
___
*Special.* This spell may also be cast as a reaction. In this case, casting it when being hit gives you resistance to all damage as well as teleports you.

#### Blizzard [level 3]
*Evocation [channel]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet, in a 15-feet-wide, 60-feet-high cylinder.
- **Components:** V, S, M (crushed glass and water)
- **Duration:** Channeling, up to 1 minute
___ 
You whisper the magic words, and a cold light emanates from your hands. A freezing cloud materializes 40 feet above the target, raining down shards of ice and heavy snow, dealing 4d6 points of damage in the area for every round of channeling. The damage is half cold, and half slashing damage, with an Agility saving throw to half damage. Creatures that fail their saving throw are also chilled for one round.

The heavy snow and hail obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. The cloud can deal damage to creatures flying under it as well, and imposes the same obscuration to sight to creatures below the cloud. As a bonus action, you can move the cloud that calls down the blizzard up to 30 feet.
___
**Heightened.** Per level above 3rd, add one dice of damage per every spell level above 3rd level.

#### Bloodlust [level 3]
*Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of dried blood or sand)
- **Duration:** Channeling, up to 1 minute
___ 
Choose a willing creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target is immune to fear, has +2 to AC, advantage on Agility saving throws, and can make an additional action on each of its turns, and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier.

This action can only be used for the attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use Object action. When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn. This extra action does not stack with similar abilities granting extra actions.

#### Brilliance Aura [level 4]
*Abjuration [aura]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 15- foot-radius sphere, centered on you
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration (partial), up to 10 minutes
___ 
A pulsing aura of cerulean power radiates from you in an aura with a 15-foot radius centered on you. For the duration of the aura, you can designate any two creatures in range to augment their spellcasting. So long as the creatures are both friendly and within range, the mana spell cost for all their spells is reduced by 2 (minimum 1).
___
**Heightened.** For every spell level above 4th, you may benefit an additional creature. At spell level 8, the mana cost is reduced by 4 points instead (minimum 1).

#### Essence Seal [level 2]
*Abjuration [ritual]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (Focus crystal that costs 25 gp per spell level)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes or until discharged
___ 
You draw an essence-capturing magic circle or seal and designate a single creature type.

If a creature from the type you designated is reduced to 0 hit points within 10 feet of the seal (or any surface you inscribe it upon), they must succeed on a Spirit saving  throw or else have its essence absorbed into the seal. If the creature’s Challenge Rating (or level) is greater than double

\pagebreakNum

the spell level, they automatically succeed on their saving throw.
___
**Sealed Beings.** A being that fails its saving throw has its essence absorbed into the seal. It cannot be revived or resurrected so long as it is trapped, and any creature attempting such effects must succeed on a contested spell attack roll against you. At a successful contested roll, the seal is weakened but not undone. At two successful rolls, the seal is broken and the essence is released. Upon failing two contested rolls (not necessarily consecutive), the singular caster can no longer attempt to undo that particular seal. An immortal creature or a creature that can reform from death (such as demons, liches, or ghosts) that are sealed similarly cannot reform until the seal is broken.
___
**Focus.** If the focus crystal is destroyed, the creature’s essence is released. The focus acts as an item with hit points equal to 10 times the spell’s level, and a damage threshold equal to 5. The exorcism spell deals double damage to focus crystals, but only to release the creature imprisoned. Depending on the creature type, the focus crystal has different names.
___
**Soul Gem.** This focus crystal holds the essence of a humanoid, giant, beast, fey, monstrosity, plant, or dragon. Soul gems can fuel all soul engines.
___
**Elemental Gem.** This focus crystal holds the essence of an elemental. This can fuel soul engines that are associated with the elemental’s same element.
___
**Quintessence.** This focus crystal holds the essence of an aberration, fiend, celestial, or undead. Quintessence can be consumed by any creature that is not a construct or an ooze to restore 1d8 hit points (or 1d4 mana points) per Challenge Rating (or level) of the creature. This causes immense supernatural suffering for the creature, and releases it from the focus crystal. If later resurrected, the target requires double the normal amount of rest for resurrection sickness.
___
Oozes and constructs cannot be affected by this spell.
___
*Special.* If you cast the spell as a ritual, you may augment the seal by spending double the normal mana cost. An augmented seal is more difficult to escape; the target creature type suffers disadvantage to their saving throw, and any attempts to release the essence by contested rolls has disadvantage.

#### Carrion Swarm [level 3]
*Evocation [sigil]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Personal (Self)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a corpse or egg of a beetle, spider, or other vermin)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, plus 3 rounds
___ 
You release a torrent of poisonous spiders, beetles and other vermin from hand to bite and infest your opponents. Each creature in a 20-foot cone must make a Stamina saving throw, or take 3d8 bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw. Targets who failed the saving throw are also infested by the swarm. Creatures infested by the swarm are considered poisoned, and suffer the primary effect at the start of your turn every round.

Whenever a creature dies while being poisoned by this spell, a carrion beetle is conjured where they once stood (exploding from the corpse). The DM has the carrion beetle’s statistics. A creature can end the infestation on itself by spending an action.
___
**Heightened.** The damage increases by one dice per every spell level above 3rd.
Special. If you are a corporeal undead, you may target one infested creature that is suffering under this spell, and transfer some of their lost life force to you. You regain hit points equal to one-half the damage dealt by the spell in that round.

#### Chaos Bolt [level 1]
*Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___ 
You throw a greenish-violet bolt of crackling chaotic energies. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. Targets struck by this bolt suffer 2d8 fel damage.

If the target is already subjected to an active sigil spell, they suffer extra fel damage for every sigil effect active. This damade is equal to half the original damage dealt by the spell.
___
**Heightened.** When cast as a 2nd level spell or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d8 for each spell level above 1st.

#### Charm [level 1]
*Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___ 
You attempt to charm one creature you can see within range. When preparing this spell, you can choose to preapare the spell to charm your creature type, beasts, or any one creature type your class can bind (see binding under spellcasting).

The target must make a Spirit saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do something harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends it knows it has been charmed. This only affects the creature type specified by the spell (a Charm Undead cannot also charm a humanoid).
___
**Heightened.** When cast as a spell of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each spell level above 1st. They must be within 30 ft. of each other when you target them. You can instead choose to target one additional creature type to the charm spell instead (Charm Person at level 2 can be Charm Person and Elementals).

#### Combustion [level 5]
*Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___ 

\pagebreakNum

You invoke combustion in a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack on a target within range. On a success, the target combusts, suffering 8d8 points of fire damage.

If the target is already subject to an active sigil spell that deals fire damage, you may force the target to suffer a sigil pulrse as if one round passed.

If the target is already burning, they lose the burning condition, and take 10 extra points of fire damage and suffer one level of exhaustion instead. A successful Stamina saving throw halves the extra damage and negates the level of exhaustion. A creature can be subject to exhaustion from this spell once every long rest.

If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.

#### Consecration/Desecration [level 2]
*Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___ 
You call upon the Holy Light to sanctify an area of a 15-foot sphere. Any creature who is hostile to the Holy Light suffers 2d8 points of holy damage if they are in the area when the spell is cast, or if they end their turn in the area, or if they enter the area (but cannot take the damage more than once per round). If the creature is neutral towards the Holy Light as a doctrine, they take only half damage. If the creature is a fiend or undead, they take half extra damage, and move at half normal speed so long as they are in the area.

Furthermore, for the duration of the spell, the area of effect is treated as hallowed (as per the spell hallow/unhallow, but cannot bind an extra effect to the area).
___
**Heightened.** The damage increases by 1d8 per level.
___
*Special.* When cast by a Death Knight or a priest that follows the Lich King or demonic forces (such as high-level acolytes), this deals shadow damage instead, targeting those hostile to their faith. The increased effect is dealt to celestials and those who directly channel the Holy Light. This is then called Desecration.

#### Concentration Aura [level 4]
*Abjuration [aura]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration (partial), up to 1 hour
___ 
A mantle of warm serenity radiates from you in an aura with a 15-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each allied creature in the area gains advantage on Stamina saving throws to maintain their concentration on spells.
___
**Aura Spike.** Causing this aura to spike allows you to add a +4 bonus to a Stamina saving throw to maintain a spell to any allied creature in the aura (including yourself).
___
**Heightened.** If this spell is cast as a 5th level spell, the bonus to the Stamina saving throw is a +5 bonus instead.
___
*Note.* This spell suppresses and is suppressed by the distraction aura spell.

\columnbreak

#### Conjure [level 1]
*Conjuration (Transmutation if Constructs or Plants, Necromancy if Undead)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute (or 1 action if creature is a beast, fey, or plant)
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a focus related to the creature, or an object of specific rarity).
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
___ 
When preparing this spell, you must choose a specific creature type tied to your spellcasting list (see Conjuring and Binding under your class’s spellcasting entry). You can conjure a creature of that type when casting this spell.
___
Choose one of the following options when preparing this spell:
* One creature of Challenge 1/2 (or one half the spell's level)
* Two creatures of Challenge 1/4 (or one quarter the spell's level)
* Four creatures of Challenge 1/8 (or the spell's level divided by 8)
___
**Specialized Preparation.** If you prepare the spell to conjure a specific creature (such as conjure imp instead of conjure fiends), you may double the maximum CR you can conjure. For instance, a 1st level mage preparing his spells may choose to either prepare conjure elemental or conjure minor water elemental. If the former, he can conjure any elemental of CR 1/2 or lower. If the latter, he can conjure a Minor Water Elemental (CR 1).

After casting the prepared spell, the creature manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. The creature can telepathically understand any command, and will execute them (no action required by you), so long as it doesn't violate its alignment or nature.

If you don’t issue any commands to the creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The telepathy only functions if you maintain line of sight to the creature or if you remain within 100 feet.

A conjured creature is dimensionally unstable, and cannot conjure or summon others (including via abilities such as the Shadow’s ability to spawn new shadows) even if they have spells that normally allow them to. Despite them obeying their conjurer’s commands, they take their own actions and are controlled by the DM when not given specific instructions (such as which spells or ability to use, etc.).

Once the duration of the spell ends, if creature is reduced to 0 hit points, or if the creature is forcefully dismissed (see below), the magic dissipates, ending all the spell’s effects. If the focus was an object (such as a couch targeted with animate constructs), it resumes the object’s original purpose.

If you cease concentrating on this spell or if your concentration breaks before the duration ends, the creature (or creatures) becomes independent in its actions, and is controlled by the DM. Typically this means that undead and elementals rampage and attack without discrimination; constructs and plants act like the objects of their focus; fey and animals defend themselves and seek refuge; and celestials and fiends promote their far-reaching aims. You may attempt to forcefully dismiss the conjured creature.

If you attempt to cast this spell again while an wild conjured creature has not yet been dismissed, the conjured

\pagebreakNum

creature must attempt a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC (as if you spent an action to dismiss an unwilling summoned creature).
___
**Forceful Dismissal.** You may use an Action to dismiss a conjured creature. The creature may choose to resist being dismissed (such as if it enjoys combat or is acting according to its nature), in which case they must attempt a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If it fails the saving throw, it is forcefully dismissed and sent away to its original realm. If it succeeds, it is no longer friendly to you nor your companions, and no longer is compelled to obey your orders (although it retains the telepathic link, unless it is bound by another spellcaster). If you fail to dismiss a creature, you can only attempt it again by casting the conjure spell again to specifically dismiss the creature.

A conjure spell remains until the duration of the spell ends or until the creature is defeated or forcefully dismissed. If the spell ends this way, the creature(s) all disappear at once.
___
**Heightened.** The maximum Challenge of conjured creatures increase, equal to one-half the spell’s level. This either allows you to conjure stronger creatures of the same type, or more creatures of the same CR.
___
**Material Component.** The spell requires a material component or focus that is related to the conjured creature. A celestial may require a page from a holy book, a fire elemental may require burning incense, and a focus for the magic is required with undead, constructs, and plants of similar size (corpses or disembodied limbs, tables or chairs, and trees or bushes, respectively). The DM describes the required material component for spells that conjure specific creatures.
___
*Note.* The conjured creature is not an actual creature, but is more a spell construct animated by the creature's personality (formed of magic, ectoplasm, or temporarily bonded to the realm). Killing it does not reward XP or hurt it in any real way. If you wish to conjure a permanent and 'real' ally, see the bind spell. If choosing a focus material for a construct, it must not bound to anything (such as nailed to a wall), not be harder than iron, nor be sophisticated in design (cannot be a gadget or vehicle).

#### Conjure Elemental Totem [level 3]
*Abjuration [array, totem]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
___ 
Once you place this totem, you may conjure an elemental within 5 feet of the totem. This acts as the 1st level Conjure spell, where the totem does the concentration. You must make the decisions on the type of creature when preparing this spell. This totem otherwise functions as all other totem spells and the Conjure.
___
**Heightened.** The Challenge of the elemental increases described under the Conjure spell.

#### Conjure Strike [level 1]
*Conjuration (Transmutation if Constructs or Plants, Necromancy if Undead) [Strike]*
___
- **Casting Time:** Special (see description)
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, up to 1 minute (riding effects)
___ 
Preparing this spell requires that you also prepare the conjure spell. By casting this spell, you allow the conjured creature to make one attack it can make. The action used by the creature to make the attack is the casting time of this spell.

The creature does not fully manifest for this purpose, but lands its hit and fades away (such as appearing in a spectral version, and landing a slash or sword attack). The attack must be within 30 ft. or its original range (whichever you wish), and requires an attack roll by the creature or a saving throw by the targets (whichever is applicable).

The creature cannot use an ability that summons other creatures, but can otherwise use spell and spell-like abilities (such as a fire breath or a healing spell). If the action done by the creature is limited in times it can be used (such as once/rest or expends mana), you retain the same limitations when you use this spell again, until the creature rests as normal.

The manifestation can be attacked, but does not occupy a space (and can share the space of another creature).

If the action done by the creature has a duration (such as casting a spell), it fades after 1 minute, regardless of its original duration.
___
**Heightened.** This spell must be heightened to the same level of the conjure spell used.

#### Corpse Explosion [level 2]
*Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___ 
You suffuse a nearby corpse or an undead creature that serves you (conjured, but not bonded) with unholy energies, filling it with so much corruption that it explodes in a 10-foot radius sphere. Creatures in the affected area can make an Agility saving throw. On a failed saving throw, they take 4d8 damage and are poisoned for one minute. The damage is half poison, and half shadow. On a successful saving throw, they take half damage and are not poisoned.

An exploded corpse is desecrated and difficult to raise or animate, and requires that they be healed up to half the damage dealt by corpse explosion. A corpse cannot be targeted more than once with the same spell.
___
**Heightened.** You may deal an additional 2d6 damage per every spell level above 2nd.

#### Counter Shot [level 1]
*Transmutation [shot]*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** Maximum range of ranged weapon
- **Components:** S, M (ranged weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
A creature within range targets you with a ranged attack or casts a spell during their turn.

Make a ranged weapon attack roll against the creature that provoked the counter shot. If the targeted creature was casting a spell, the DC to concentrate on their spell is increased by 5 points from its normal DC.
___
*Note.* Unlike most shot and strike spells, this does not cost a bonus action, and costs a reaction instead.

\pagebreakNum

#### Cripple [level 5]
*Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.
___
You cripple any living target within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a success, the target takes -2 to AC and to Agility saving throws, can’t use its reactions, and may make either an action or a bonus action every turn (not both). Regardless of the creature’s abilities, it may only make one melee or ranged attack on its turn, and they deal only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength or Agility.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Stamina saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.

#### Curse of Agony [level 2]
**Necromancy [sigil] [curse]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, plus 3 rounds
___
You curse one living target within range with searing agony, setting their nervous system ablaze. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target suffers 2d4 fel damage. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.

Also, so long as the spell is active, the target is treated as if they gained a level of exhaustion for one round (even if they are normally immune to the condition, except if they are immune and are also constructs or undead) until the beginning of their turn in the next round.

If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.
___
**Heightened.** The damage increases by one dice per every level above 2nd.
___
*Special.* Whenever the sigil roll succeeds, the target takes 1d4 additional damage the next round, up to 50% extra damage dice.

#### Crusader Aura [level 3]
**Abjuration [aura]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
Invigorating energies radiate from you in an aura with a 15-foot radius centered on you. All allied creatures within the aura’s range increase their movement speed by 10 feet, and are automatically stabilized when reduced to 0 hit points.
___
**Aura Spike.** Causing this aura to spike allows you designate any number of creatures in your aura that have been reduced to 0 hit points and stabilized, and heal them all 1 hit point. This healing does not affect undead or constructs.
___
*Note.* This spell suppresses and is suppressed by the unholy aura spell.

#### Curse of Shadows [level 5]
**Necromancy [curse]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
___
Upon casting this spell, you must succeed on a ranged touch attack to affect a target within range. On a successful hit, you may curse them with the inability to quickly heal. The target receives only half (-50%) the normal amount of healing from spells and effects that restore hit points. This includes regeneration and similar effects, doubling the duration between healing (alternatively, halving the healing gained).

Alternatively, this spell can weaken the target’s mana restoration, affecting mana points instead.

#### Curse of Tongues [level 3]
**Necromancy [curse]**
___
- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
You target one target within range with the curse of tongues, stealing their voice and causing them to speak in no other language than the dark tongue of Eredun. On a failed Spirit saving throw, the target is cursed, causing them to speak only Eredun.

Any spell that has a verbal component requires double the normal time to cast. If the target is a good-aligned character, they take 1 point of Psychic damage whenever they speak Eredun. This damage is inflicted once per round of speech.
___
*Special.* Due to the effect being temporary, there is no risk of losing Spirit points by being forced to speak in Eredun. Creatures that can speak uncorrupted Eredun are immune to the effects of this spell.

#### Curse of Weakness [level 3]
**Necromancy [curse]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
___
Upon casting this spell, you must succeed on a ranged touch attack to affect a target. On a successful hit, you may curse them with weakness. The target deals only half damage with weapon and spells attacks. Indirect damage such as sigils, bleeding effects, and other abilities are unaffected.

#### Cyclone [level 3]
**Evocation**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet, in a 10-feet-wide, 30-foot-high cylinder.
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You target one creature in the area to be affected by a powerful cyclone of rising winds. The creature, once affected, is entitled an Agility saving throw to be unaffected and be moved out of the cylinder radius (to any direction chosen). If the character cannot move away, it is affected regardless, but takes half damage from any falls or cyclone damage.

The creature targeted rises vertically so long as you are concentrating on the spell, and remains in the middle of

\pagebreakNum

the cyclone (15 feet in the air).

At the end of each round, the creature may make another Agility saving throw to escape the cyclone, falling out of it and halving fall damage. The creature cannot otherwise move away, unless they can fly and succeed in an Acrobatics check against your spell DC, or manage to latch onto a nearby surface and succeed on an Athletics check. If they attempt to cast spells, they are treated as if distracted, and all attacks made by them are made with concealment from the winds. Only one creature can be held by the cyclone at any given time.

You may use your action to drop the original target creature and lift another one, or to toss the creature.
___
**Dropping a Creature.** Dropping a creature forces the original target to suffer fall damage from its midair height (15 feet for medium creatures, or 1d6 fall damage) and subjects another within the cyclone’s area of effect to being lifted by the cyclone.
___
**Tossing a Creature.** Tossing a creature with cyclone’s full power raises them to the maximum height (30 feet for medium creatures) and drops them from that height to any area within 15 feet away. A successful Agility saving throw when hurled halves the fall damage and drops the creature at any chosen point between the target area and the cyclone’s area.

As a bonus action, you can move the cyclone up to 30 feet.
___
*Special.* Depending on the creature’s size, the cyclone’s strength is affected.
Using an action to toss the target instead doubles their midair height (to the maximum height allowed by the spell) for every action spent.

For example, small and tiny creatures are lifted 20 and 30 feet into the air once caught by the cyclone, respectively, while large creatures are only lifted 10 feet. If tossing a tiny creature, it is sent instantaneously, while a large creature needs an additional round to toss them 30 feet away (one round to elevate them to 20 feet, and another to elevate them to 30 and toss them).

| Size | Midair Height |
|:-:|:-:|
| Tiny | 30 |
| Small | 20 |
| Medium | 15 |
| Large | 10 |
| Huge | 5 |
___
**Heightened.** You may target another creature in your cyclone effect and increase the midair height by 5 feet per every two spell levels above 3rd. All creatures must be at least 10 feet within reach of one another to be affected in an ongoing cyclone effect. Tossing or dropping a creature requires an action for each target.

#### Dark Void [level 6]
**Evocation [totem]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
___
You conjure a minor gateway to the Twisting Nether that spews corruptive energy and harvests the weak of body. When you cast this spell, you may use a reaction for it to cast shadow word pain on up to three targets. At the start of the
___
totem’s turn, if there are less than three targets affected by shadow word pain, the totem casts it again. If the totem causes a target to be bloodied by the spell, the totem instead casts shadow word death spell on the target, removing the shadow word pain sigil.

If a creature dies under the effects shadow word death, you or one target of your choice within 30 feet regain 1d6 hit points.
___
**Heightened.** For each level the spell is heightened above 6th, both shadow word pain and shadow word death spells are heightened for one level.

The spell deals normal damage to any structure in contact with the ground when the spell is cast, and every round until the spell ends. See Chapter 8: Adventurers for structure damage.
___
**Heightened.** The spell deals an additional 1d6 for every spell level above 5th.

Invoking the power of death, you bring the living closer to the end, and invigoration to the unholy or undead. The creature you target regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier if they are undead or fiends. If you target a living or celestial creature, they take damage equal to the hit points they would normally gain as shadow damage. If you target an unwilling creature, you require a ranged spell attack.

#### Death Pact [level 1]
**Necromancy**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You siphon latent soul-magic from an undead or fiendish creature within range to heal yourself. The target (if intelligent) is entitled a Spirit saving throw to negate this effect.

The target loses 3d6 hit points, which you regain as hit points. The target (if intelligent) is entitled a Spirit saving throw to negate this effect.

If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed as normal for its type, and you are affected by the inner fire spell (spell equal to the death pact spell level).

Instead of regaining hit points, you can cast the spell for no mana at all, and regain 1d4 mana points when draining the power from an undead or fiendish creature.
___
**Heightened.** For each level above 1st, you drain 3d6 additional hit points (and regain the same), or regain 1d4 extra mana points.

#### Demon Skin [level 1]
**Conjuration**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Personal (Self)
- **Components:** V, S, M (grounded tooth dust)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
You speak the words of power, and your skin becomes ragged and solid.

The spell ends if you dismiss the spell as an action.
___
**Heightened.** When you cast this spell as a 2nd level spell or higher, the temporary hit points increase by 3 for each spell level above 1st.

#### Demonic Doom [level 9]

If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.

If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points, this sigil does not end. If the creature dies while still under the effects of demonic doom, and if it has a CR higher than 2, its corpse
___
is destroyed, and a column of fire appears, dealing 9d6 points of fel damage to all targets in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on the corpse. A Doomguard Champion is conjured on the spot, and it remains for a minute. The DM has the Doomguard's statistics. The Doomguard starts uncontrolled, requiring the charm fiends or dominate fiends spell to control. The DM has the Doomguard's statistics.

#### Denounce [level 2]
**Abjuration**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
A creature within range is hit with a critical hit.

You may cast this spell as a reaction against any creature hit with a critical hit. Make a ranged spell attack against the attacker. On a success, their hit then is no longer a critical hit.
___
**Heightened.** If heightened to 4th level, you have advantage on the required spell attack.

#### Detonate Mana [level 4]
**Evocation**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You target an area with a 10-foot sphere of black-purple anti-magic. Where the sphere explodes, all creatures that can use mana lose 1d4 + 1 mana points, and take 2 arcane damage for every mana point lost.

If the creature loses more than 3 mana points this way, they are subjected to a dispel magic effect (spell level equal to the Detonate Mana spell level – 2).
___
**Heightened.** The number of mana points drained increases by 1d4 points per every two levels above 4 (2d4 + 1 at level 6).
___
*Special.* Demons always have active mana, and can always be targeted with mana burn. If they have no mana, they still take 2 points of arcane damage per potential mana burn point.

#### Devotion Aura [level 1]
**Abjuration [aura]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
Protective energies radiate from you in an aura with a 15-foot radius centered on you. All allied creatures in the area suffer 2 less points of weapon damage (to a minimum of 1 point of damage).

A hostile creature attacking your allied creature can attempt a Spirit saving throw against your aura DC. If they succeed on the saving throw, the damage from their attacks is not reduced by this spell.

This spell is suppressed by the protection from good and evil (and similar abjurations). This is an aura bonus.
___
**Heightened.** For each spell level above 1st, allied creatures in the aura’s area of effect take 1 less point of damage (up to 6 less points of damage at spell level 5).

\pagebreakNum

*Note.* This spell suppresses and is suppressed by the abandonment aura spell.

#### Distraction Aura [level 4]
**Abjuration [aura]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration (partial), up to 1 hour
___
An unnatural deathly buzz radiates from you in an aura with a 15-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each hostile creature in the area suffer disadvantage on Stamina saving throws to maintain their concentration on spells. A creature can negate this effect if they succeed on a Spirit saving throw once within the aura’s area.
___
**Aura Spike.** Causing this aura to spike forces a single hostile creature in the aura that already failed the saving throw to act as if they were distracted for the purposes of spellcasting.  
___
*Note.* This spell suppresses and is suppressed by the concentration aura spell.

#### Divine Shield [level 2]
**Abjuration**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Personal (Self)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You raise your hand, and are protected by the grace of the Holy Light. A powerful shielding ward protects you, granting you 4d8 temporary hit points so long as the spell is active. Furthermore, the temporary hit points can also be spent to absorb spells (3 hit points per spell level).

If the shield manages to absorb all damage from an effect or absorb a spell, you are protected against any secondary effects (as if immune). This can be determined after a saving throw.

The spell cannot be overwhelmed with one attack. If reduced to 0 temporary hit points with one attack, the spell ends with 1 hit point instead. This can occur only once for every instance of the spell being cast.
___
**Heightened.** For every spell level above 2nd, the number of temporary hit points increases by 2d8.

#### Dominate [level 5]
**Enchantment**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You attempt to beguile a creature you can see within range. When preparing this spell, you can choose to be able to dominate humanoids, beasts, or one creature type your class can bind (see binding under spellcasting).

It must succeed on a Spirit saving throw or be dominated by you for the duration (as Charm). If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the target is dominated, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious
___
(no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Spirit saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends. This only affects the creature type specified by the spell (a Dominate Undead cannot also dominate a humanoid).
___
*Special.* If choosing to affect beasts only, the spell’s level is decreased to 4th level instead, as their minds are more malleable.
___
**Heightened.** When you heighten this to a 6th-level spell, the maximum duration becomes 10 minutes. This increases to 1 hour to 8 hours as 7th and 8th spells, respectively.

For each spell level the dominate spell is heightened, you can add one additional creature type to the dominate spell (level 6 dominate can dominate humanoids, elementals, or undead for up to 10 minutes).

#### Drain Life [level 4]
**Necromancy [channel]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Channeling, up to 1 minute
___
You can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds by tethering their life-force to yours, causing a stream of life-force to surge. Make a spell attack against a creature within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 fel damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of fel damage dealt. If the target is Bloodied, the spell deals (and heals) double damage.

The stream of life may be blocked by losing line of sight or effect, or moving at least 60 feet away from the target, at which case the spell is dispelled. Medium creatures or smaller cannot block the stream, but Large creatures generally do, as well as anything that blocks magical vision or effect (such as a sheet of lead, etc.).
___
**Heightened.** When you cast this spell as a 5th level spell or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each spell level above 4th.

#### Drain Mana [level 4]
**Necromancy [channel]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Channeling, up to 1 minute
___
You shoot your hand forward, and drain mana from your target, drawing it out from their eyes, nose, and mouth in blue rope-like streams.

The target of this spell loses 2d4 mana points every round, while you gain half the mana taken. The stream may be blocked by losing line of sight or effect (as Drain Life),

\pagebreakNum

at which case the spell is dispelled. Creatures the caster’s size or smaller cannot block the stream, but creatures larger than they generally do. Mana restored this way cannot exceed your maximum mana points.

You may also use this to push a number of your own mana points at the same rate. Unlike most mana-restorative effects, drain mana has no limit of once per hour.
___
**Heightened.** You increase the mana stolen by 1d4 mana points for every two spell levels heightened (and mana regained, as appropriate).

#### Earthbind Totem [level 4]
**Evocation [totem]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
___
Once you place this totem, you may use a reaction to target any creature within 90 feet of it with the effect of Earthbind, as the spell of the same name. The totem automatically concentrates on any target you choose.

This totem otherwise functions as all other totem spells.

#### Earthquake [Level 5]
**Evocation**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 30-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Stamina saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken. When you cast this spell, and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make an Agility saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
___
**Fissures.** Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM.

Each is 10 feet deep, 5 feet wide, and 20 feet tall. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Agility saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure deals 10 points of damage to it (see structures below). Depending on the geological presence under the earth, the fissure can act differently, but in all cases, the fissures close at the end of the spell:
- **Volcanic.** If the fissure is over a volcanically-active region (as adjudicated by the DM), the fissures shoot out lava instead of opening cracks in the earth. The fissures instead create a shallow pool of rapidly-cooling lava that deals 2d10 points of fire damage at the beginning of the creature’s turn every round.
- **Geysers.** If the fissure is over a geyser-active region (as adjudicated by the DM), the fissures shoot out hot water instead of opening cracks in the earth.
* **Underground Water.** If the fissure is over underground water reservoirs, the fissures reveal water instead if the depth of the fissure reaches it, and it arises to fill the fissure itself. On average, most underground water is 50 feet deep, but it sometimes reaches more (up to 100 feet) in arid regions.
* **Structures.** The tremor deals 10 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with a fissure opened by the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, regardless of environment (although lava deals extra damage). This stacks with the damage the structure would take if a fissure opens beneath it. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Agility saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.
___
**Heightened.** When cast as an 8th level spell, the range of the spell increases to 500 feet, and the radius of the spell becomes a 100-foot-radius circle.

The depth of the fissures created by the spell become 1d10 x 10 feet deep, and their area becomes 10 feet wide. Furthermore, the fissures extend from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side, instead of being 20 feet tall. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse. The tremor also deals 50 damage per round until the spell ends, instead of 10. A lava fissure’s area expands to the entire area instead.

#### Earth Shield [level 2]
**Transmutation [sigil]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, plus 3 rounds
___
You conjure a shield of earth to guard and protect a creature within range. The target gains 2d4 temporary hit points.  The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, replenishing the temporary hit points.

Also, so long as this sigil is active, the target also gains a +2 bonus to their AC.
Heightened. For each spell level above 2nd, you add 1d4 extra temporary hit points.

#### Elemental Armor [level 1]
**Abjuration [array]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (an object struck by the element)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
A protective magical field surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral element. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration of the spell. If a creature hits you with a weapon or spell attack while these hit points remain, they may manifest one of the following effects, depending on whether the element is Fire, Frost, or Lightning.

\pagebreakNum

* **All.** The attacker takes 1 point of elemental per point of damage they deal (maximum equal to the remaining temporary hit points). The target must be within melee reach.
* **All.** You may gain resistance against the damage (only if the armor’s element matches the damaging element). This reduces the temporary hit points by 5.
* **Frost or Lightning only.** The target is chilled for one round.
* **Fire only.** Target is scorched for one round.
___
**Heightened.** The temporary hit points increase by 5 for every level above 1st.

___
Make a spell attack roll at a target within range. You blast the target with a burst of elemental energy, dealing 2d8 damage from any of elemental damage type you choose (chosen from acid, cold, fire, or lightning). Furthermore, depending on the damage type you choose, the target also suffers a secondary effect if they fail a Stamina saving throw.
* **Earth (acid).** The target is pushed 10 feet in any direction you choose.
* **Fire (fire).** The target is scorched for until the beginning of your turn in the next round.
* **Frost (cold).** The target is chilled for until the beginning of your turn in the next round.
* **Storm (lightning).** The target takes disadvantage to attack rolls until the beginning of your turn in the next round.

**Abjuration [array, totem]**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
___
Once you place this totem, you may use a reaction to target any creature within 30 feet of it with a blast of elemental energy, as the spell elemental shock.

This totem otherwise functions as all other totem spells.
___
*Special.* This spell costs one less mana point than normal for its spell level.

#### Elemental Tongue [level 1]
**Evocation [strike]**
___
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute, or one use (whichever comes first)
___
You may apply this strike to any melee weapon attack. This deals additional 2d6 damage, chosen from any type of elemental damage you choose when you cast the spell. This deals an additional effect as elemental shock.

**Conjuration**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
By targeting one creature within range, you sprout thorny vines and weeds that constrict on them. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or else be restrained by the entangling weeds so long as you concentrate. While the creature is restrained, they take 1d4 damage every round (the type is either piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning).

They may use an action every round to make a Strength check against your DC again. On a success, it frees itself, and the plants wilt away.
___
**Heightened.** The damage dealt increases by 1d4 per level above 1st and can entangle another creature within 5 feet.

#### Exorcism [level 2]
**Evocation**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You call upon the Holy Light (or forcefully draw out fel or shadow magic) to harm fiends or undead. Make a ranged spell attack. If the target is a fiend or undead, they take 4d10 holy damage.

If the target is a creature under a possession or possession spell by an undead or fiend, only the possessing creature takes the damage, and the victim may re-roll against the possession effect with advantage.

If the target is charmed or dominated by an undead or fiend, or is a conjured or bound undead, the target creature may (instead of being damaged) have the spell dispelled if it is of a spell level 2nd or lower. If higher, you must succeed on a spellcasting ability check against a DC of 10 + spell level.

Alternatively, if the target is an unrestrained conjured creature, the exorcism spell can send it back to its origin plane if the target fails a Charisma saving throw. If it succeeds, you may still deal damage to it on a successful spell attack.
___
**Heightened.** The damage increases by 2d10 for each spell level above 2nd.

#### Explosion [level 1]
**Evocation**
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (empty egg shell)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, or up to 3 rounds
___
You draw power into the material, and then release it to explode either instantaneously or delayed for up to three rounds. This explosion deals 2d6 concussive damage in a 10-foot radius sphere and knocks them prone. If a creature passes an Agility saving throw, they take only half damage and are not knocked prone.

The explosion also releases a splash of damage beyond the explosive’s area, dealing 2 point of damage of the same type 5 feet away from the blast.

\pagebreakNum

A successful Agility saving throw against this effect negates the damage entirely.
___
**Heightened.** For each level above 1st, you add an additional 1d6 damage (and one additional point of splash damage).
___
*Special.* When preparing the spell, you can instead make the explosion deal fire, cold, lightning, or acid damage.

#### Fade [level 1]
**Illusion**
___

You may exclude a number of potential targets from being affected by the spell equal to your spellcasting ability score modifier. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

\pagebreakNum

causing it to explode in a 10-foot radius sphere. The explosion releases a burst of numbing cold. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or take 4d8 cold damage in the area on a failed saving throw, or half the normal amount passing the save. If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid with similar freezing points, the spell freezes the liquid within its active radius to a depth of 6 inches for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming or that were in the water at the moment must succeed on an additional Strength saving throw as an action versus your spell DC or be restrained.

You can throw the sphere further than the spell's normal range by retaining it and releasing it via a sling with an attack action (up to the sling's normal range). After 1 minute of being conjured, the sphere shatters.

**Evocation**
___
- **Casting time:** 24 hours

- **Components:** V, S, M (500 gp in oils and incense, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

\pagebreakNum

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy, ancient, or elemental) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. Depending on your casting class, you can rely on one power. You may repeat a hallowing on another area within the radius of the original hallow, in which case the chained spell costs less materials (375 gp per 60 feet of hallowed ground).

Druids rely on the power of ancients; priests can rely on holy or unholy power; paladins rely on holy power; death knights rely on unholy power; and shamans rely on elemental power. The affected area is subject to the following effects.

First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead (chosen by the caster) can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect. If such barred creature attempts to enter the area, it must succeed on three Charisma saving throws. If it fails on two saving throws, it cannot attempt re-entry for one week.

Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.

* **Bloom (Ancient power only).** The area blooms of plant life. It creates materials for herbalism and alchemy (equal to half the material components consumed by the spell), and it can support large trees. This can be even used in hostile environments (such as deserts or in the Outland), but it is more easily dispelled (dispeller gains advantage to dispel).
* **Blight (Unholy only).** The area is blighted to kill plants and corrupt all life. It loses three-quarters of all herbalism and alchemy materials, and sterilizes the land (as if salted). In a blighted area, undead can rest and restore hit dice normally without using magic or special abilities (such as cannibalism or vampirism). Binding undead in an area of blight costs only one-half the normal cost.
* **Blessed (Holy only).** The area is blessed to provide all allied creatures with the benefits of the Bless spell (useable up to three times at any given 24 hours).
* **Courage.** Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area from any source.
* **Darkness.** Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the level you used to cast this spell, can’t illuminate the area.
* **Daylight.** Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the level you used to cast this spell can’t extinguish the light.
  Energy Protection. Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
* **Energy Vulnerability.** Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
* **Elemental Activity (Elemental power only).** The hallowed area is attuned to elementals. It is treated as an inverted magic circle, but only for the purposes of binding elementals. If convinced to perform a task that serves the elemental powers, you gain advantage to Charisma checks to convince them, and the gold cost for the spell is reduced by three-fourths.
* **Everlasting Rest.** Dead bodies interred in the area can’t be turned into undead.
* **Extradimensional Interference.** Affected creatures can’t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means so long as they are within the area.
* **Fear.** Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.
* **Silence.** No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it. Tongues. Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don’t share a common language.
___
*Special.* When hallowing inside a building, the spell’s effects are limited by it, becoming a shapeable spell. So long as the spell’s area of effect fills at least half the building, it can be treated as affecting all of it.

#### Healing Stream [level 3]

___

Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability. The duration of this effect is Concentration, up to 1 hour. You can maintain this hex and use another in the same array.
* **Fortune (level 1).** As the Bless spell.
* **Love Hex (level 1).** As the Charm spell, but can affect any creature type, so long as that finds you attractive.
* **Misfortune (level 1).** As the Bane spell.
* **Dream Eat (level 2).** You can deal 2d6 psychic damage to a sleeping target per spell level, healing one-half the damage you deal. If the target dies from this, they are instead trapped in eternal sleep (this is treated as a curse effect. Breaking the curse awakens the target normally).
* **Bone Lock (level 3).** As the slow spell.
* **Spell Steal Hex (level 5).** As the Spell Steal spell. This still requires you to prepare the dispel magic spell.
___
**Heightened.**
* **Death Hex.** When you cast this spell as a spell of 3rd, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you cast this as a 5th level spell, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.

It must make a Spirit saving throw. If it fails, it is paralyzed until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
___
*Special.* If choosing to exclusively affect beasts, the spell’s level is decreased to 1st level instead, as their minds are more malleable.
___
**Heightened.** When you cast this spell as a 3rd level spell or higher, you can target one additional creature for each spell level above 3rd. They must be within 30 ft. of each other when you target them. You can instead choose to target an additional creature type to the hold spell instead (Hold Person at level 2 can be Hold Person and Elementals at level 3).

Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 minutes
You call down a well of light for ten minutes that lands on the five-foot square specified. Whenever a creature touches the lightwell, you may use your reaction to heal them 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier in hit points. This is treated as a 1st level holy light spell. A single creature cannot benefit from the lightwell more than three times before they require a short rest.
Heightened. The lightwell remains for five more minutes more per every spell level above 3rd, to a maximum of 30 minutes, and the spell level of the Holy Light spell increases by one level per level heightened.

Living Bomb [level 5]
Evocation [sigil]
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous, plus 3 rounds
You infuse your target with a seed of arcane power (fire or frost) in the target’s body. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, an elemental bomb nests into the target, dealing 5d6 points of fire or cold damage. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.
Also, so long as the spell is active, the damage from the spell is added up to a total pool of damage. If the spell ends (such as if the target is reduced to 0 hit points or when its duration ends, but not if it is dispelled), the living bomb explodes. All creatures (including the target) suffer the accrued damage dealt by the spell, halved on a successful Stamina saving throw. The target suffers disadvantage to this saving throw.
If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.
Heightened. The damage increases by one dice per spell level above 5th.

Lunar Curse [level 3]
Necromancy [curse]
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You touch a humanoid to imbue a sliver of the lunar curse within them. If the creature fails on a Spirit saving throw and you maintain concentration and line of sight to it for up to 1 minute, the creature is cursed to turn into a were-creature (such as a Worgen or werewolf).
The cursed creature begins suffering psychological torment and their body begins their transfiguration. For three days, they will avoid gatherings of their same kind. At this stage, a break curse can reverse the spell if the target can succeed on a spellcasting check versus your own, or one dispel magic for each of the three days of transformation. Otherwise, this moves to the third stage.
At the end of the three days, the target's transformation will be complete, and they will become Worgen (or any were-creature chosen by you). Initially-transformed Worgen cannot transform back to humans (or their original creature type) until after 1 week of rampaging violence (though they may attempt a Spirit saving throw once every day to end the rampage).

Mana Burn [level 2]
Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You target a creature that has mana within 30 feet. A ray of black-purple anti-magic leaps out, and strikes the target, draining them of mana. You must make a ranged spell attack with the ray. On a success, the target loses 2d6 mana points. For every mana point lost, the target takes 1 point of arcane damage.
The target is entitled a Spirit saving throw. On a success, the mana and hit points lost are halved.
Heightened. The number of mana points drained increases by 1d6 point per every two levels above 2 (3d6 at level 4, 4d6 at level 6, 5d6 at level 8).
Special: Demons always have active mana, and can always be targeted with mana burn. If they have no mana, they still take 2 points of arcane damage.

Mana Shield [level 1]
Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Personal (Self)
Components: V, S, M (a sapphire worth at least 10 gp)
Duration: 1 hour
You raise a transparent blue shield of force. This effect remains only so long as you have at least 1 mana point in your pool. For every 2 points of damage you take that are not internal (such as from starvation), you may sacrifice 1 mana point to negate.
Hostile effects that would normally reduce your mana pool or deal mana damage instead deal normal (arcane) damage to the shield, and do not reduce your mana pool. If you suffer an effect that would also ignite lost mana (such as the mana burn or detonate mana spells, but not casting spells normally), you only suffer the initial damage as described above, and your mana is not detonated.
Heightened. A single mana point can absorb 3 hit points per mana at spell level 4, and 5 hit points per mana point at level 8.
Special. This spell does not cost mana to cast.

Mana Tide Totem [level 6]

Casting Time: 1 action

If the spell ends (such as if the target is reduced to 0 hit points or when its duration ends, but not if it is dispelled), the rift explodes into a wave of chaotic psychic energy. All creatures (including the target) suffer one-half the accrued damage dealt by the spell, and are incapacitated for until the start of your turn in the next round. A successful Stamina saving throw halves the damage and negates the condition.
If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.

If the caster is casting a spell of 5th level or lower, they automatically fail. The target is also both silenced (as the mute spell), and deafened (as deafness).
If they are casting a spell of 6th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability versus a DC of 10 + spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and is silenced as per the spell mute.

Mind Vision [level 4]
Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You focus your mental powers into seeing through the target’s eyes, hearing through their ears, and sensing through them. This can be negated on a successful Spirit saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target shares all images, sounds, words and sensory messages they receive with you for the duration of the spell.
You may (so long as the spell is active) attempt to charm or dominate the target with another spell, and both spells can be concentrated on at the same time.
At the beginning of the target’s turn every round, they may attempt another Spirit saving throw to end this effect (or both effects, if the target is charmed or dominated through the vision).

You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials.
For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, the material reverts to its original substance.

You call down a 5-foot wide, 30-foot high cylinder of astral moonlight that permeates the target’s very core. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 holy damage. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.
Also, if the target is shapeshifting, or is under the effects of a polymorph spell or comparable effect, they must make a Spirit saving throw whenever they take the damage or else revert to their normal form until the spell’s duration ends. If the target is not under such effects, they instead take 1d4 extra points of fire damage when subject to a spell that deals fire damage.
This cannot overpower class abilities unless the spell’s level is double the class’s level or equal to or greater than the spell level of the polymorph spell. If the target is cursed, the spell must be of 5th level or higher.
If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.

Adhesive. The target becomes stickier. They gain advantage to grapple checks and checks related to climbing or holding.
Ability Score Boost. The target gains +2 to one attribute, but -2 to the opposite attribute. Strength is opposed to Intelligence, Agility to Spirit, and Stamina to Charisma.

Resistant Skin. The target reduces damage taken from one damage type of the target’s choice by 3 points (minimum 0 damage).
Thicker Skin. The target gains a natural armor bonus equal to +2. This does not stack with normal armor.
Sensitive Eyes. The target’s eyes become more sensitive. They gain darkvision 60 feet, or increase the range of existing darkvision by 30 feet.
Heighten. You can increase the bonus and penalty to attribute mutation or armor by +1 for every spell level above 1st level, or energy resistance by 5 points above level 1. Alternatively, you may add another mutation for every two spell levels this is heightened.

Mute [level 2]
Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You target a creature within range, forcing it to make a Spirit saving throw. If it fails, the target is isolated from all sound, causing it to be silenced and deafened. This prevents it from performing the verbal components of spells, and rendering it immune to Thunder damage and effects of a spell equal to the spell’s level or lower.
Heightened. You may target another creature within 30 feet of the original target for every 2 spell levels above 2nd (2 creatures at level 4, 3 at level 6, and 4 at level 8).

Each hostile creature in the area that is reduced to 0 hit points or fails a death saving throw restores 1d4 hit points to you and two allies of your choice that are within the aura’s range.
Undead and constructs do not restore hit points this way, neither do creatures with insignificant life-forces (such as harmless critters or sickly victims).
Heightened. For each spell level above 2nd, you may add an ally to the total who can be healed (up to 5 allies at spell level 5).
Note. This spell suppresses and is suppressed by the retribution aura spell.

Nether Tempest [level 6]

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (A forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You tear open the planar barriers to cause a rift of chaotic power. A 5-foot-diameter tear in reality appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. The tear can be suspended in mid-air. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the rift must make an Agility saving throw. The creature takes 6d6 points of arcane damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
As a bonus action, you can move the rift up to 30 feet. If you push the rift into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere’s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn. If the target fails their saving throw, they take damage as described above, and are restrained in the sphere. The target may attempt to escape as an action (Escape DC equal to your Spell DC). If you move the sphere again, the target is no longer restrained.
Heightened. The damage increases by one dice per every level above 6th.

Orb of Annihilation [level 2]
Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You throw a crackling sphere of black and purple energy at a target or 5-foot-intersection within range. This requires a ranged spell attack. The orb deals 4d6 points of fel damage. A successful Agility saving throw halves the initial damage.
The spell has an additional effect on the target depending on if it is an object or creature:
If an object, the object takes double damage.
If a creature, the target’s maximum hit points is reduced by one-half the damage dealt by the spell (up to a maximum reduction to half maximum hit points). This reduction is restored after a long rest.
Heightened. For every spell level above 2nd, the direct damage dealt by the spell increases by 1d6.

Parasite [level 2]
Conjuration [sigil]
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous, plus 3 rounds
You inject a parasitic conjured creature into the target. Make a ranged spell attack against any creature within range. On a hit, the target suffers 2d6 poison damage and becomes a host for the parasite. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.
If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.
If the creature dies while under the effects of parasite, poisonous fume arises from the corpse, dealing 2d6 points of poison damage in a 5 foot-radius sphere centered on the corpse, halved on a successful Stamina saving throw. The parasite is summoned on corpse, and it remains for duration of Concentration, up to 1 minute.
You can implant any creature that as part of the spell so long as it is one or more size categories smaller than the target. The conjure spell you refer to is lower than the parasite spell in spell level.
Heightened. The damage increases by 1d6 per spell level above 2nd.
Note: The creature you implant must be a creature you can conjure.

Power Word Shield [level 3]

Polymorph [level 4]
Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Spirit saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

Possession [level 6]
Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (Special, see below)
Duration: Until dispelled
To cast this spell, you must first prepare a gem, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp, and suffuse it with your magic for one minute. So long as you have this Soul Container on your person, you can project your soul in and out of it as a focus (see Soul Container and Project Soul below).
While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move or use reactions, and are immune to effects that do not target undead and do not deal magical damage. The container can be attacked as normal.
The only action you can take while in your soul container is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container to do one of the following things:
Return to your living body
Possess a humanoid’s body within 100 feet. If you are not a humanoid yourself, you can instead choose to possess a creature of the same creature type as yourself
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends prematurely by another means (such as the exorcism or dispel magic spells), your soul immediately returns to your body if it is within 100 feet of the container, otherwise you die.
Project Soul. You can attempt to possess a target you can see (creatures warded by a barrier ward, protection from evil and good, or magic circle ⁠spells can't be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in your container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours. If you are targeted by the essence seal spell while projecting your soul (such as if there is a seal between you and the target), you must save against being entrapped by it.
Once you successfully possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature though you retain your alignment and your intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at all, unless they also know how to cast the possession spell, in which case they may attempt to cast the spell, and possess another target or force you to return to your original body, ending the spell.
An effect cannot target you independent of the possessed body unless the target both knows you are possessing it, and if the effect deals magical damage (and you take damage of those types only). For purposes of targeting you, your soul is treated as if an undead (and can be turned by effects that do that).
While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to your Soul Container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you are possessing it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own Spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die as well.
If your body is more than 100 feet away from you, or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies. Any souls that pass in and out of the Soul Container are valid targets for the essence seal spell.
When the spell ends (such as by you returning to your body after a possession), the Soul Container is destroyed.
Special. If you are incorporeal, you do not need to prepare a Soul Container, and your incorporeal form disappears when casting the spell, reforming when you are ejected from the body. If the target dies when you are possessing it and fail the Charisma saving throw against your Spell DC to escape its body, you still die.

Psychic Horror [level 3]
Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Personal (Self)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You project a phantasmal current of fear all around you, creating a blast of mental energy. Each creature within a 20-foot radius sphere centered on you must succeed on a Spirit saving throw or drop whatever they are holding and become frightened for the duration. While frightened, the creature can only use the Dash action to move away from you by the safest route available to it unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it does not have line of sight to you, they can make a Spirit saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

Pyroblast [level 7]
Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Channeling, up to 1 minute
A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Agility saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make an Agility saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 150 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes. The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
Heightened. When you cast this spell as an 8th level spell or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each spell level above 7th.
Special: Some effects count as a round of concentration for a pyroblast spell.

Primal Attunement [level 6]
Abjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 24 hours
You invoke elemental spirits to protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a 30—foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube, usually centered on a totem or monolith. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.
The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
The entire warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell’s caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.
Blessing of Air. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of blue light floating in the air.
Blessing of Earth. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares with debris or withdraw them as a reaction. This becomes difficult terrain. A creature can also benefit from cover behind the debris, but this costs 5 feet of movement to take cover behind.
Blessing of Fire. Whenever a creature friendly to you takes 10 feet of movement in the area, it is propelled ahead 5 additional feet. The area is also warmly-heated, and gives advantage to any saving throw against hostile weather effects.
Blessing of Water. Any creature in the area that regains hit points from a spell 1st level or higher regains an additional amount of hit points equal to your Spirit modifier (minimum 1).
Elemental Guardians. Up to four minor elementals of each type (air, earth, fire, water) arise to guard the attuned area, except that they cannot speak. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the elemental guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders.  The elemental guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the elemental guardians do nothing. The elemental guardians can‘t leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears.
Additional Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:
A constant gust of Wind in two locations of your choice
Spike growth in one location of your choice
Wind wall in two locations of your choice
To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless.

Rain of Fire [level 3]
Evocation [channel]
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet, in a 15-feet-wide, 60-feet-high cylinder.
Components: V, S, M (crushed glass and water)
Duration: Channeling, up to 1 minute
You whisper the magic words, and a hot, red light emanates from your hands. A burning cloud materializes 40 feet above the target, raining down meteorites and clumps of fire, dealing 4d6 points of damage in the area for every round of channeling. The damage is half fire, and half bludgeoning damage, with an Agility saving throw to half damage. Creatures that fail their saving throw for half damage also have their speed reduced by 10 feet.
The meteorites set fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver or bronze.
The cloud can deal damage to creatures flying under it as well, and imposes the same obscuration to sight to creatures below the cloud. As a bonus action, you can move the cloud that calls down the rain of fire up to 30 feet.
Heightened. Per level above 3rd, add one dice of damage per every spell level above 3rd level.

This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures nonmagical Diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical Diseases, curses, or similar effects, if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.
This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target suffers from resurrection sickness (see resurrection under chapter 1: introduction).

With the grace of the nature, you envelop one living creature within range with a blessing that rapidly closes wounds and rejuvenates the target. The target regains 1d4 hit points as an primary effect. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, for three rounds.
Also, so long as the spell sigil is active, the target also gains advantage against any effect that would cause exhaustion. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while under the effects of this spell, the spell ends as normal, but automatically stabilizes the target.

Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self (15-foot radius)
Components: V
Duration: Concentration (partial), up to 1 hour
An elemental protective ward radiates from you in an aura with a 15-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you.

Renewing Light [level 1]
Evocation [sigil] [healing]
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S

You place a mark of the light on the target within range, flooding them with holy power. The target regains 1d4 hit points.

If you target an unwilling creature, you must succeed on a ranged spell attack. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.
Also, so long as the spell is active, the first creature that attacks the target has disadvantage to their attack roll (if you choose).
Constructs gain no benefit from this spell.
Heightened. The healing taken increases by one dice per every level above 1st.

Resistance Totem [level 5]
Evocation [totem]
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Once you place this totem, you may use a reaction target any creature within 30 feet and grant them resistance to one elemental type in response to an attack (choose between acid, fire, cold, lightning, and thunder).

Resolve [level 1]
Transmutation [stance]
Casting Time: 1 reaction
Components: S
Range: Personal (Self)
Duration: 1 minute, or one use (whichever comes first)
Reaction. You are subjected to forced movement.
You enter a stance that represents the swaying reeds in the face of a storm. When you are subject to physical forced movement (such as being pushed, knocked prone, or tripped), you can use this stance to gain advantage to any check (or an contested Strength check if no check is available). If you successfully remain unmoved, you gain an attack of opportunity against them or may cast a cantrip.

Resurrection [level 7]
Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Components: V, S, M (a diamond or alchemical reagents worth 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
This acts as the raise dead spell, but you can raise a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 100 years, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't Undead. The character returns to life with all its hit points.
Unlike raise dead, this spell restores any missing body parts, including ones that are required for survival (heart, head).
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target suffers from resurrection sickness as per raise dead.
Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Heightened. By heightening resurrection two levels (to level 9), it becomes true resurrection. The material component increases to 25,000 gp, and the spell becomes stronger as per the following:
The target cannot have been dead for more than 300 years.
The target does not suffer from resurrection sickness.
You do not suffer a penalty for casting the spell, regardless of how long the creature has been dead.
The spell does not need a corpse, and can create a new body if the old is unavailable (although this requires knowing the target’s name).
If the target is an intelligent undead and their soul is free and willing to be targeted (not imprisoned, compelled, or currently animated), the spell creates a new living body for them, effectively returning their creature type to their original (humanoid if a Forsaken).
You have advantage to attempting to free an imprisoned soul if you are attempting a true resurrection.

Retribution Aura [level 2]
Abjuration [aura]
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self (15-foot radius)
Components: V
Duration: Concentration (partial), up to 1 hour
An aura of righteous anger radiates from you in an aura with a 15-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. If a hostile creature in the area successfully attacks you or one of your allies within the aura, you may make a ranged spell attack against that creature, so long as they are in the aura. On a hit, the spell attack deals 1d4 points of holy damage. This attack effectively originates from the hurt ally (and hence may ignore cover). This costs no action on your part, and you may choose which attacks to react to.
The aura can retaliate one time per spell level every round (2 at level 2).
Note. This spell suppresses and is suppressed by the necrotic aura spell.
Special. If cast by a druid, the ward deals piercing damage instead, and is called thorns aura.

Revivify [level 3]
Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (diamonds or alchemical reagents worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. If you target undead, they return as normal undead (and are not returned to life).
Special. This spell can target any creature type except Constructs, Celestials, or Fiends.

If you target an undead or a fiend with this ability, they take holy damage equal to the hit points they would normally gain. If you target an unwilling creature, you must succeed on a ranged spell attack. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.
Also, so long as the spell is active, a single spell that affects the target while under the sigil’s effects is subject to a dispel effect (as if a dispel magic spell was 1st level). The dispel effect requires spending a reaction.
Constructs gain no benefit from this spell.
Heightened. The healing taken increases by one dice per every level above 1st. The effective level of the dispel magic also increases by one level.

Rune Array [level 1+]
Necromancy [array, rune]

You may grant this healing to any ally within 30 feet. This healing has no effect on constructs. This applies to your first attack in a given round.
Worm Rune (DKN 4). While under the effects of this rune, your strikes infuse the enemy with a virulent magical ailment that spawns a worm under the target’s skin. A living target suffers 2d6 damage every round so long as the target is not healed from the incubating worm. If the target loses at least 10 hit points from the bleeding, the worms increase in size, and form a visible tumor under the target’s skin. At this point, releasing the rune has an additional effect. If the target is subject to a healing spell, roll 1d4. On the result of a 3 or higher, the worms shrivel and die without effect.
Release.
Releasing the rune has the following effect when released.
Frozen Wastes Rune. The target of the Death Knight’s Runic Strike instantly suffers 2d4 extra points of damage of the rune’s type, the target is chilled for one round.
Blood Rune. If releasing the rune with a Runic Strike, the target takes bleed damage equal the damage the rune dealt for one minute. A successful Stamina save halves the damage and the duration.
Worms Rune. If the worm deals at least 10 hit points of damage and is released, it explodes into a spray of blood. The target must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or suffer the 2d6 shadow damage. Also, regardless if the target succeeds or fails on the saving throw, the amount of hit points the worm gathered heals all undead creatures you designate within 30 feet, or harms all living creatures you designate within the same range. The amount of healing or harm is equal to the amount of hit points it dealt when incubating.
Heightened.
Plague Rune. The base damage increases by 1d6 damage per level above 1st.
Blood and Frozen Wastes Runes. The damage taken per hit increases by 1d4 per spell level.

This allows you to remove 0-level spells, and must make an ability check versus a spell level of 1 or above. This dispel effect cannot dispel a spell level higher than that of Arcane Shot.
Black Arrow (level 3). Your shots are transformed into missiles made of unholy energy. The shot deals an additional 3d4 points of shadow damage to the target. If a creature is killed by this strike (or if most of the damage it took was shadow damage from this spell), they are animated as per the spell conjure undead (spell level 1). This raises the target from the fresh corpse. The killed creature is not raised if they are normally immune to the effect. Knowledge of this shot is typically a secret, and is usually used by the Forsaken, the Scourge, and ruthless independents.

Kill Shot (level 2). Your shot is unusually successful against wounded targets. If the target is bloodied, this attack is treated as a critical hit. After being affected by this critical hit, a creature cannot be affected again by this spell for 1 hour. If the hit was already a critical hit (such as by a dice roll or another ability), this shot is not expended, and you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage per spell level.
Scorpid Shot (level 2). Your shot is enhanced with a venomous agent. If you strike an enemy with this shot, they are poisoned. The effect remains for one minute. On a successful Stamina saving throw, the enemy negates this effect.
Searing Shot (level 1). Your shots are infused with searing flame. They deal 1d6 extra fire damage. The searing shot adds +1 to your attack roll if shot at a target beyond optimal range of your weapon.
Stopping Shot (level 1). If you use this shot as a held action, this deals damage normally, and reduces the creature’s move speed to 0, and knocks them prone if they used the Dash action. On a successful Stamina saving throw, their speed is instead reduced by half.
Tranquilizing Shot (level 1). Your shot are enhanced with a sleeping agent. If you strike an enemy with this hit, roll 5d8. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for a creature to , fall unconscious for one minute.

A creature may roll a Stamina saving throw to reduce the duration of sleep to one round.
Venom Shot (level 1). Your arrow is enchanted with a poisonous agent. If you strike an enemy with this hit, you deal an additional 1d8 poison damage. This damage is halved on a successful Stamina saving throw.
Viper Shot (level 1). Your arrow is enchanted with an anti-magic agent. If you strike an enemy with this hit, they lose 1d2 mana points. For every mana point lost, the target takes 2 points of arcane damage. This damage is halved on a successful Spirit saving throw. This is otherwise treated as mana burn (as the spell).
Arcane Shot (level 2). Your shots are transformed into missiles made of pure force, dealing an additional 1d4 points of arcane damage. If the creature you successfully shoot has the benefits of a beneficial spell, it is also subjected to a 1st-level dispel magic spell. This allows you to remove 0-level spells, and must make an ability check versus a spell level of 1 or above. This dispel effect cannot dispel a spell level higher than that of Arcane Shot.
Kill Shot (level 2). Your shot is unusually successful against wounded targets. If the target is bloodied, this attack is treated as a critical hit. After being affected by this critical hit, a creature cannot be affected again for 1 hour. If the hit was already a critical hit (such as by a dice roll or another ability), this shot is not expended, and you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage per spell level.  
Wing Clip Shot (level 2). Your arrow is enchanted to strike a creature’s hamstring or movement joint. If you strike an enemy with this hit, they take an additional 1d6 weapon damage, have their speed reduced by 10 feet, and can’t take reactions until the start of their next turn.
Black Arrow (level 3). Your shots are transformed into missiles made of unholy energy. The shot deals an additional 3d4 points of shadow damage to the target. If a creature is killed by this strike (or if most of the damage it took was shadow damage from this spell), they are animated as per the spell conjure undead (spell level 1). This raises the target from the fresh corpse. The killed creature is not raised if they are normally immune to the effect. Knowledge of this shot is typically a secret, and is usually used by the Forsaken, the Scourge, and ruthless independents.
Wyvern Shot (level 3). Your arrow is enchanted with a debilitative agent. If you strike an enemy with this hit, you reduce the target’s maximum hit points by 3d4 for one hour. This damage to hit points is halved on a successful Stamina saving throw. A creature cannot be affected by this more than once at any given hour, and when the duration ends, their maximum is restored. If a creature’s maximum is reduced below their current hit points, the excess is treated as temporary hit points (if the maximum is restored, these temporary hit points return to be actual hit points).
Heightened.
Arcane Shot. The strike’s damage increases by 1, and the dispel magic effect increases by 1 level per level above 2nd.
Black Arrow. The strike’s damage increases by 1d4 per each two spell levels beyond 3rd. The spell level also increases by 1.

To steal a 5th level spell, the creature must fail on a Spirit saving throw, and you must succeed on a dispel attempt (as the dispel magic spell).
If you successfully steal the spell, you can choose the spell’s parameters or effect as if you cast it instead of the target, or you can choose to store it. The spell’s remaining duration is unchanged.

Whenever one of the linked creatures is damaged, they share up to 5 hit points of damage taken by one of the creatures in the spirit link among the rest, distributing the damage evenly amongst them all. This requires one reaction every round to activate, though the damage is totaled before distributed.
The damage, once shared, is considered untyped damage, which bypasses immunities, vulnerabilities, and resistances. If any ally is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends prematurely.
Heightened. You can share an additional 5 hit points per two spell levels above 3rd.

After you cast this spell, your soul is tethered to your body beyond the limited scope of death.
If you die within 1 week of casting this spell, you may spend mana equal to half the cost of this spell level to keep your soul tethered around your corpse for up to 1 minute. So long as your soul is tethered this way, you can return to your body and revive it (as the revivify spell). If you are subjected to the essence seal spell, this spell grants you advantage to your saving throw to avoid having your essence be captured.
If you do not return to your body within the minute of tethering, the spell ends, and you die normally.
This spell may be detected as if a normal active spell (via detect magic or abilities that detect magical auras). If the spell is dispelled, you die as if you didn’t return to your body.
Special. This spell does not cost mana to cast initially.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You point to the open sky, calling down a cylinder of normal light centered on you, 60 feet wide, and 100 feet high.
At the beginning of every round where you channel the spell (the first round does not count), choose any two points within the cylinder. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere at the point of impact must make an Agility saving throw as a shooting star blazes down to smash into the area. On a failed saving throw, a creature or object struck by the star takes 5d6 damage. The damage is half arcane, and half bludgeoning damage. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half damage. A creature who fails the saving throw for half damage is also pushed 5 feet away from the center of the blast.
Special. This spell requires line of sight to the sky, although it does not require a specific time. If the spell is cast at night, the shooting star deals additional holy damage instead of arcane damage.

Half the damage is arcane, and the other half is holy. The damage from either burst is counted as a separate spell for the purposes of any abilities that trigger off spell damage. Furthermore, the target is treated as if they were affected by the secondary sigil effects of both the sunfire and moonfire spells for up to 1 minute. The target is entitled an Agility saving throw to half the damage and negate the secondary effect.
Heightened. The spell deals an extra 1d8+1 points of damage per every level above level 5.

Duration: 10 minutes
You plant the totem in the ground anywhere within 30 feet. It is visible for 1 round, before becoming invisible for the rest of its duration (gaining advantage to Stealth, with a Stealth bonus equal to yours). Once invisible, it is effectively active. If a creature moves within 10 feet of the totem during its activity, you are notified of the presence, and you are aware of their creature type and direction of movement (but nothing more).
If you use your reaction to send the mental command, the totem explodes into a shower of sparks easily seen from up to a mile, lighting up the totem and the area for one round. All creatures 10 feet away from the totem must make an Agility saving throw or be stunned until the beginning of their turn the next round.
Heightened. The trap remains for ten more minutes more per every level, to a maximum of 100 minutes.

Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a lens)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of brilliant light flashes out from a brilliant mote in your hand in a 5-feet-wide, 30-feet long line. Each creature in the line must make a Stamina saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 holy damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on his saving throw. You can alter the line of radiance as an action on the beginning of any turn until the spell ends. Your hand emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is treated as sunlight.

Duration: Instantaneous, plus 3 rounds
You call down a beam of brilliant sunlight that floods the target’s being. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d4 arcane damage. The sigil pulses at the start of your turn every round, repeating the primary effect.
Also, so long as the spell is active, your moonfire spell’s duration increases to match that of sunfire, and you increase the DC or attack bonus of any holy spell you cast by +2.
If the ranged spell attack misses, the spell deals half the initial damage and has no other effect.

Telekinesis [level 3]
Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You can manipulate creatures or objects within range of the spell. When you cast the spell or start your turn concentrating with it, you may choose a creature or object to exert your will upon. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.
If choosing a creature, make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength saving throw. If you win, you can move the creature up to 15 feet within the spell’s range, and the creature is restrained. The creature has advantage to this saving throw if it is larger than you. The creature must end its movement in a space it can occupy.
If choosing an object, you can move an unattended object up to 500 lb. up to 15 feet within the range of this spell in a space it can occupy. If targeting an attended object (such as held or worn), you must succeed on an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested to the creature’s Strength saving throw. The creature has advantage to this saving throw if the item is held by two hands or worn by it. A creature can also attempt to wrest control of the object using the same roll. You can exert fine control over the object (such as unlatching a door instead of simply pushing it, or choosing a specific item to manipulate via telekinesis).
While concentrating on this spell, you can also use an action to channel the spell. If channeling, you can hold the creature or object of the spell in mid-air instead of simply moving them, or you can choose to damage them by telekinetically constricting them. This deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per spell level every round. A character can attempt another contested check at the end of its turn every round to escape the spell.
If your turn ends without a creature or object held by the spell, the spell ends prematurely and its energies dissipate.
Special. Death Knights usually call this spell Death Grip, and mages and warlocks often use this spell to restrain and bring down aerial creatures (calling it Aerial Shackles instead).
Heightening. Per every 2 levels above 3rd level, you increase the spell's range by 30 feet, maximum duration by 5 minutes, speed of movement by 15 feet per round, and the maximum mass of moved objects by 500 lb.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Personal (Self)
Components: V, S, M (splinter of wood)

Tranquility [level 5]
Evocation [healing] [channel (optional)]
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Personal (Self)
Components: V, S, M (a live rose)
Duration: Concentration or channeling, up to 1 minute
A soft magical rain-like light descends within the area around you in a cylinder 15 feet wide, and 60 feet high. When you invoke this rain, you can choose for the power to concentrate on up to six targets, or wash on every creature and object in the area.
Concentrated Rain. Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see regain hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The rain-like light appears to concentrate on the targets. The targets are healed at the beginning of your turn every round. This is a concentration effect.
General Drizzle. You may treat this spell as if a channeled spell. All living and natural creatures (including natural structures and plants) in the area are healed 2d4 + 2 point of damage per round of channeling.
Any creature who benefits from this spell also seems to become younger and healthier for their age (remaining until the spell's duration ends). Plants briefly grow buds (or attempt to, if too old) and show a healthy lustrous sheen, before returning to their previous state.
Undead and constructs gain no benefit from tranquility, and are not harmed by it.

Transmute Material [level 3]
Transmutation [ritual]
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Components: V, S, M (original mineral, which is consumed, the alchemical recipe, and a philosopher's stone)
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous
You transmute one material into another by the power of alchemy. You must have mastered the knowledge of the target material (counts as an uncommon alchemical recipe for the purpose of time required for research). The mineral changes into the new one, with the appropriate properties, but maintains the same cost (decreasing or increasing in mass as appropriate); hence 1 pound of gold (50 gp) can be transmuted to 500 pounds of iron (50 gp) so long as you have alchemical knowledge on how to make iron. If the new material is an alloy, you require only the required component materials, and you can transmute the new material (such as Truesilver from Mithril and Thorium).
If changing the material of a cohesive object (such as a weapon), the surplus materials of the object’s mass are treated as crafting and raw materials. If the object’s mass would decrease, the object is instead destroyed unless you can provide the remaining cost.
As described with destroying infused materials, you cannot transmute an item that has been attuned to. For instance, transmuting an adamantine breastplate into an iron one grants surplus materials, but doing the reverse turns the breastplate into a spec of adamantine, effectively destroying the armor as an object. Once you cast this spell, you cannot transmute the same mineral until you complete a long rest. You require proficiency in Alchemist’s Supplies to cast this spell.
Special. If you studied a specific crafting material, you can transmute other crafting materials from other types to the one you have studied, such as turning harvested fire elemental crystals to water elemental crystals.

Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it adds 1d4 extra points of damage on weapon attacks that are modified by Strength, adds 1d4 to its attack rolls, and gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. This extra action does not stack with similar abilities and spells granting extra actions.
For each round of acting under the spell, the target of this spell takes 5 (2d4) points of shadow damage, and reduce their maximum hit points by 2. The target may roll a Stamina saving throw to end the spell. When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it. The maximum hit points of the creature returns to normal at the end of a long rest.
