*“The sands of time have run out”*<br>
*- Medivh, the last Guardian*

Many have waited for Blizzard to approve another conversion of their world to the tabletop playing
realm. Alas, many waited in vain.
 
*“We will persevere.”*<br>
*- The Blood Elves*

However, tabletop players are well-known for their persistence and tenacity in getting what they
want to play - or at least, satisfying themselves with an adequate enough replica.
 
*“Sometimes, the hand of Fate must be forced.”*<br>
*- Illidan Stormrage*

And thus, the World of Warcraft 5e RPG Conversion begun.

This conversion is of the much-loved World of Warcraft Role universe, as for 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons, made by the fans, for the fans.

This not only includes special classes, races, and magical spells, but also includes magical items, and even a few subsystems (such as infusion, mana, and crafting) built in the streamlined format of 5th edition, for the benefit of all roleplayers.

# Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters

<div class="wide">
When determining your ability scores (also known as attributes), there are two new methods to
create them; the focused method, and the heroic method. Both yield higher attributes on average,
suitable for the many challenges in the Warcraft universe.
</div>

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

<div class="wide">

## Ability Score Summary

</div>

#### Strength
___
- **Measures:** Natural athleticism, bodily power
- **Important for:** Death Knight, Paladin, and Warrior
- **Racial Increases:** Bronzebeard Dwarf (+1), Draenei (+2), Forsaken (+1), Orc (+2), Human (+1), Tauren (+2), Troll (+1, +2 if Drakkari), Worgen (+1)

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>
 
#### Agility

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

## Determining Ability Scores

#### Focus and Foible. 

This method leads to more focused characters with clearer weaknesses.

Before applying modifiers, choose one focus (an ability score you‘re good at) and one foible (an ability score you‘re bad at).<br><br>

*Focus*. Mark this attribute as 18

*Foible*. Mark this attribute as 8
<br><br>
Set your remaining attributes at 10, and distribute 16 points among the ability scores in any way you desire. You may reduce an existing attribute by up to 2 points to gain 2 points to add to another attribute.
 
\columnbreak

#### Intelligence
___
- **Measures:** Mental acuity, information recall, analytical skill
- **Important for:** Alchemist, Mage, Tinker
- **Racial Increases:** Dark Iron Dwarf (+1), High Elf (+1), Void Elf (+1), Nightborne (+1), Gnome (+2), Goblin (+2), Forsaken (+1) Human (+1), Orc (+1), Troll (+1)

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

#### Spirit

- **Important for:** Druid, Priest, Shaman
- **Racial Increases:** Wildhammer Dwarf (+1), Draenei (+1), Forsaken (+1), Human (+1), Night Elf (+1), Orc (+1), Pandaren (+1), Tauren (+1), Troll (+1)

#### Heroic Roll

This method leads to generally stronger characters than by normal rolling.

For each ability score, roll 2d6 + 6.

\pagebreakNum

## Beyond 1st Level

The rules in the World of Warcraft 5e RPG also include crafting sub-systems and classes (such as the Alchemist and Tinker), and
various options (such as the Infusionist feat) that can translate wealth into character power.

When creating a character from above 1st level, refer to the following guidelines for expected wealth for level to give a general
idea how to keep characters on the same general level of wealth.

Refer to the Item Creation Complexity and Cost Table on Chapter 7 to calculate item rarity. Note that crafting an item costs one half the cost of buying it.

| Level  | Typical Wealth |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | 0 (or background starting wealth) |
|  2  | 140 gp |
|  3  | 280 gp |
|  4  | 420 gp |
|  5  | 560 gp |
|  6  | 4,500 gp |
|  7  | 8,400 gp |
|  8  | 12,300 gp |
|  9  | 16,200 gp |
|  10  | 20,100 gp |
|  11  | 24,100 gp |
|  12  | 42,400 gp |
|  13  | 60,700 gp |
|  14  | 79,000 gp |
|  15  | 97,300 gp |
|  16  | 116,000 gp |
|  17  | 134,000 gp |
|  18  | 362,000 gp |
|  19  | 590,000 gp |
|  20  | 818,000 gp |

The amount of wealth carried by a character can vary significantly depending on starting resources, unexpected loot gained in the
campaign, whether or not characters have downtime to gather additional wealth, inherited gold, or even possessing companies
and strongholds under their control.

\columnbreak

##### Magical Item Budget

A DM may refer to the above chart to determine the total worth of magic items the characters have, without actually explicit magic items to be sold.

In this case, the wealth is not the expected wealth of the character, but the cost of the magic items the player should have by the
appropriate level. This can come in the form of quest gifts, a normal item improving into a magical one, or a permanent blessing or
infusion upon a held item.

The expected cost of magic items relative to rarity is present in Chapter 7.

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

##### Expected Downtime

In case of crafting classes (Alchemist and Tinker), or in cases where characters can create magical items (taking the Infusionist
feat), a good amount of downtime to allow the classes to function at a competitive rate is usually 5 days to 1 week between adventures (or the same time for every 3-5 combat encounters).

That way, very complex projects (2 weeks) like building a mecha or vehicle can be done every two adventures.

With such options available, players benefit more from wealth and time to build the exact items they need, from scrolls, potions,
explosives, and more spells in a mage's spellbook, to advanced constructs and vehicles such as gyrocopters, so exercising
judgment is key.

\pagebreakNum

# Chapter 2: Races

<div class="wide">

The races of Warcraft are diverse and rich. Each race has a role in the world, and their deeds resonate through the ages. Members of each race view each other with assumptions formed by past conflicts and alliances. Warcraft‘s history is troubled and epic, and every aspect influences the races, their beliefs and their roles.

The races described here are not the only races in the Warcraft world, but they are the most dominant, influential, and prone to adventuring. Other races can be found in the Monster Guide.

## Draenei

The draenei are a powerfully-build alien race that originates from Argus. They are powerfully magically-attuned, and have the potential for exceptional good or evil. Draenei who succumb to fel magic form the ranks of the Eredar, the greatest generals of the Burning Legion, while draenei who serve the Holy Light are immortal crusaders for justice across the cosmos.

### Draenei Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit or Intelligence<br>      increases by 1.<br>
***Age.*** A typical Draenei claims adulthood around 100 years<br>     old, and can live to about ten thousand
years old.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own<br>     affiliations.<br>
***Size.*** Draenei stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and<br>     average about 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.
As befitting their Eredar heritage, Draenei have hooved feet, tendrils that grow from the neck and
short tails, and their skin color is affected by the magic they naturally absorb (with fel magic
reddening them, holy magic rendering their skins blue to violet, and void magic darkening them to
brown).
Males‘ skulls are rigid (giving the appearance of a bone plate under their skin), while females grow
foot-long, graceful curved horns.
Males range anywhere from seven feet tall to eight feet tall and weigh on average around 300 or 400
pounds. Females stand at six to seven feet tall and only weigh around 170 or 250 pounds when
fully grown.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.<br>
***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness
as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Draenei Combat Training*** You have proficiency with the longsword, greathammer, glaive, and the
heavy crossbow.<br>
***Fel Resistance.*** You have resistance to fel damage.<br>
***Heroic Presence.*** You can spend 10 minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their resolve to fight.
When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:626px;'></div>

yourself) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you and who can understand you. Each creature can gain
temporary hit points equal to your level + half your Charisma or Spirit modifier. A creature can‘t
gain temporary hit points from this feature again until it has finished a long rest. Alternatively, you
may declare use of this ability upon landing a critical hit.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Eredun. The Eredun Draenei speak is an
altered dialect that is less corrupt, and thus does not impose penalties when speaking, but is
perfectly understandable by fiends.<br>
<br>
***Male Names.*** Amka, Doruno, Kozza, Sarhash, Shunn,<br>     Thylon, Voluth<br>
***Female Names.*** Corevva, Daalny, Demetra, Fetwa,<br>     Lan‘era, Me‘era, Tanmatra<br>
***Family Names.***  Draenei do not have family names, but<br>     take a title according to their deeds.

#### Subraces

Ancient events divide the draenei into two sub-races: unbroken and broken, Choose one of these subraces.

</div>

### Krokul (Broken Draenei)

*“You will learn our ways…”*
<br><br>
The Broken, also known as Krokul in Draenei, are a mutated and devolved subrace of draenei who
lived in Outland. They, like most of the orcs, fell prey to the demons' sinister influence and were
changed by the corruption. Though they lost some of their former powers, the Broken still present
a clear danger to all races through Outland. The largest known faction of Broken in Outland, the
Ashtongue Deathsworn, is currently led by Akama. They are supposedly allied with Illidan
Stormrage.

#### Affiliation
***Independent.*** Despite the (mostly) accidental regression into broken, many unbroken
draenei not only distrust them but despise them. Although understandable of those broken who
remain corrupted or in service to the Legion, one would think that the unbroken would be willing
to welcome any of their people that survived the orcs' genocide. Most broken are independent as a
result, although the Prophet Velen, the leader of the unbroken, does extend a hand to broken to
help them find their way back.

#### Krokul Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility increases by 2.<br>
***Adapter.*** You may always act when surprised at a combat<br>     encounter (even if you failed your
Perception check to<br>     notice it). You also have advantage versus weather effects.<br>
***Stalker.*** You have proficiency with the Perception and<br>     Stealth skills. If you already have proficiency
with one of<br>     these skills, you gain Expertise instead.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:566px;'></div>

### True Draenei

*“The Legion's end draws near.”*
<br><br>
As one of the enlightened cousins of the Eredar, the Draenei arrived in Azeroth after the reopening
of the Dark Portal. Living out the last centuries in exile and escape from the Burning Legion, the
Draenei are steadfast champions of the Light, and will do anything in their power to prevent
another world from falling to the Flame.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** Unbroken draenei have found that they have strong bonds with humanity
and dwarvenkind due to their shared worship of the Light, and kinship with the now-mortal night
elves.

#### True Draenei Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength increases by 2.<br>
***Gift of the Naaru.*** You can use your action to channel holy energy, casting the renewing light spell as
if cast as a 1st level spell. This can be used once, replenishing on a short or long rest.
While a creature benefits from this ability, they have a glowing blue mark above their forehead
(shedding light equal to dancing lights). Your spellcasting ability modifier is Spirit or Charisma (your
choice).<br>
***Gemcutting.*** You are proficient with artisan‘s tools (jewelcrafting kit).

## Dwarf

Dwarves are short and stout creatures mostly inhabiting Khaz Modan in the Eastern Kingdoms.
They are shorter than humans but taller than gnomes, taking advantage of their size when possible
and relying on their robustness and strength when not. The average dwarf is steady, observant and
composed.

### Dwarf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Stamina score increases by 2.<br>
***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they‘re considered young until they reach the age of 40. On average, they live to be 450 years old.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own affiliations ever since the great War of the Three
Hammers<br>
***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. Male dwarves tend to have long hair, and beards or facial hair often tied in ornate braids. Female dwarves also have sturdy muscular frames, but they are buxom and lack facial hair, despite the claims of some of the less educated sages of other races.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Natural Armor.*** Your skin is as hardened leather in toughness. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Agility modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.<br>
***Stoneform.*** You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Stamina modifier to the number rolled,

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:591px;'></div>

and reduce the damage by that total. If the damage exceeds any ongoing bleed damage you take, you end the effect as well. After you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<br>
***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with one artisan‘s tool of your choice: smith‘s tools, brewer‘s supplies, mason‘s tools, or mining tools.<br>
***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarven. Dwarven is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

#### Subraces

Three main subraces of dwarves populate the worlds of Azeroth: Hill dwarves
(Wildhammer Clan), Mountain dwarves (Bronzebeard Clan), and Dark dwarves (Dark Iron Clan).
Choose one of these subraces.

### Wildhammer

*“To the skies!”*
<br><br>
As a hill dwarf, you probably hail from the Wildhammer clan and its allies, and live in the Aerie Peak. Wildhammer dwarves are similar in appearance to their Ironforge kin, though many shave their heads and they are slightly taller and leaner. Exposure to sun and high winds darkens and toughens their skin. Wildhammers string beads and feathers into their hair and beards as good luck charms, and paint tattoos on their bodies in homage to the totems, ideas and creatures they revere.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or independent.*** The Wildhammer clan is not a member of the Alliance, but Wildhammer dwarves are allies of the Alliance and would certainly help it in a war (and have done so in the past). They are distant with humans and Ironforge dwarves, but have formed a kinship with high elves. Wildhammers and high elves shared much in common in the past, including a love of nature and hatred of evil. Many high elves have grown introverted and brooding of late, which concerns the Wildhammers. The dwarves are appalled at the defection of the blood elves, an event which has caused them to see their high elf allies with new eyes. They also get along well with night elves, as the two races share much in common.

#### Wildhammer Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit score increases by 1.<br>
***Bravery.*** You have advantage to all saves against fear.<br>
***Mountain Born.*** You're acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. You're also naturally adapted to cold weather in the wilderness or while exploring.<br>
***Natural Handler.*** You have proficiency with Animal Handling. If handling beasts that naturally live in mountains such as gryphons or mountain lions, you gain Expertise instead.<br>
<br>
***Male Names.*** Kazdin, Hagrim, Dondar, Soldrin.<br>
***Female Names.*** Kella, Lorim, Ar-ya, Senica.<br>
***Family Names.*** Beastclaw, Greatbeard, Thundertamer, Windseer.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:431px;'></div>

### Bronzebeard

*“For Khaz Modan!”*
<br><br>
As a mountain dwarf, you probably hail from the Bronzebeard clan and its allies, and live in Khaz Modan. Ironforge dwarves are stout and powerful, with short muscular bodies, and prefer tying their hair (male or female) in ornate braids.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** While the dwarves of Ironforge appreciate the fighting skill of the Horde, it is with grim eyes that they look upon the orcs and their allies, the trolls and the Forsaken. Although the dwarves have held dealings of commerce and diplomacy with the high elves, they keep the people of Quel‘Thalas at an arm‘s distance. While the night elves may share the same allegiances, the dwarves look upon them with suspicion and some trepidation. Humans, however, are the staunch and constant allies of the dwarven people and find welcome, favor and kindness when in dwarven lands.

### Dark Iron

*“You shall serve.”*
<br><br>
As a darklands dwarf, you probably hail from the Dark Iron clans, lead by the Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan. Reviled as betrayers of their fellow dwarves, and living in the mountain-halls of Blackrock Mountain, Dark Iron dwarves are slaves to the great elemental Firelord Ragnaros, and serve him in the latent volcanic mountain.<br>
Dark Irons seem identical to Ironforge dwarves, except that their skin tones are ashen and gray, and their eyes are golden-red. Dark Irons who adventure can often reach into the power in their bloodline and spontaneously conjure flames.<br> 
Hoarse of voice and prone to undertone muttering, Dark Irons do not inspire trust easily.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or Independent.*** Hatred comes to Dark Iron dwarves against all races, and in their service to Ragnaros, they see only rivals, thralls, and enemies. Some dark irons have found kinship with their cousins the Wildhammers and the Bronzebeards, and chose to join the Alliance.

#### Dark Iron Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases<br>
by 1.<br>
***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with firearms and explosives of all types, even if
you do not have proficiency in engineering, and gain proficiency in light armor.<br>
***Fire-Lord’s Favor.*** You have resistance to fire damage.<br>
***Burning Heart.*** You know the produce flame cantrip (caster level equal to your character level).
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

***Male Names.*** Beld, Franclorn, Lokhtos, Grall.<br>
***Female Names.*** Aster, Channis, Mogran, Wellia.<br>
***Family Names.*** Angerforge, Darkbargainer, Firesmite, Forgewright.

## Elf

An elf is a member of one of the longest lived species on Azeroth known for keen perception, grace, and great spellwork. Elves were once believed to be the first race to awaken on Azeroth.

### Elven Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 2.<br>
***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. A high elf typically claims adulthood around the age of 60 and can live to be 750 years old. A night elf claims adulthood and live up to five times said age (adulthood at 300 and live up to 3,750 years old). Until the World Tree was destroyed, the Night Elves were immune to aging effects.<br>
***Affiliation.*** Each sub-race is inclined to its own affiliations ever since the Great War of the
Ancients.<br>
***Size.*** A high elf (and hence a blood and void elf) is usually a little over 6 feet in height and weighs between 100 to 175 pounds, depending on gender. Night elves (and hence Nightborne) are imposing in stature, males being on average 7 feet tall.
Male Kaldorei are very muscular, with broad chests and shoulders, indicative of the strength that lies within both their minds and bodies. Female night elves are lithe and curvaceous, yet still muscular and strong.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Mystic Senses.*** Whenever you make any check related to the origin of magical items, lore, or spells, you are treated as if you have Expertise in the Arcana skill.<br>
***Keen Senses.*** You are proficient with the Perception skill.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:766px;'></div>

***Elven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the longsword, longbow, rapier, and shortbow.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven (any dialect, see Chapter 4). Elven
is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar, even with strange dialects such as Nazja.
Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.

#### Subraces

Ancient divides and use of mana siphoning (or mana vampirism) among the elven people
resulted in several main sub-races: high elves (and the blood and void elves), and night elves (and
the Nightborne), Choose one of these subraces.

### High Elf (Quel’dorei)

*“For Quel‟Thalas!”*
<br><br>
As a high elf, you hail from Silvermoon in Quel‘Thalas or Dalaran. High elves stand slightly taller
than humans do.

The elves are slim, with sharp symmetrical features, often an exaggeration of perfect beauty. The
high elves are uniformly fair in complexion, with white to flaxen colored hair. Their eyes are
incredibly intense in color, seeming to glow with an inner light. While many high elves have blue
or green eyes, violet and red are not unheard of.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or independent.*** Most of the high elves have placed themselves under a selfimposed exile, ashamed of the damage that they have wrought upon the world of Lordaeron with their abuse of arcane magic. While humans still accept the high elves because of the aid that both races provided each other during the most recent attacks of the Burning Legion, many of the other races will only deal with the high elves if absolutely necessary. This is especially true after the acts of Kael‘thas Sunstrider.<br>
The night elves in particular do not care for the company of high elves and in some cases can be openly hostile toward their sun-blessed brethren. The passing of time may heal these wounds, but the use of arcane magic will always draw a rift between these two breeds of elf.

#### High Elf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases<br>
by 1.<br>
***High Magic.*** You know the prestidigitation cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a spell 1st level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the mute spell as a 2nd level spell.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these
abilities (even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities (and after using
them for one hour), your eyes glow a pale blue.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level), they are always prepared
for free.<br>
***Arcane Legacy.*** The high elves are uniquely attuned to magic. You can choose one of the below abilities.
* You increase your mana pool size by 2 mana points.
* You add an additional cantrip to your High Magic ability, chosen from the mage spell list.
* You gain the Suffused Arrows talent. You may only take this if your first level is a hunter.
___
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Mariel, Athaniar, Anandor, Tharama, Viridiel, Malanior.<br>
***Female Names.*** Anarial, Freja, Driana, Coria, Alanassori, Azshara.<br>
***Family Names.*** Boughstrider, Dawnblade, Lightbringer, Morningray, Suntreader.

### Blood Elf (Sin’dorei)

*“Power! My people are addicted to it... a dependence made manifest after the Sunwell was destroyed.”*
<br> -- Kael‘Thas Sunstrider
<br><br>
Following the Third War, 90% of the High Elven population was slain during the Siege of Silvermoon and the Razing of Quel‘Thalas. Prince Kael‘Thas Sunstrider renamed his people the Blood Elves (Sin‘dorei) following this terrible event.<br>
With their homeland destroyed, their forests burned and corrupted, and their beloved sacred Sunwell sullied, the Blood Elves underwent mana withdrawal.<br>
Therefore their culture is more warped due to their insatiable thirst for vengeance: most have abandoned worship of the Light, and
their allegiances have also changed, and most suffer psychologically from extensive use of mana siphoning, due to the Sunwell‘s corruption and subsequent destruction.<br> 
A DM should consider applying the mana withdrawal optional rule with Blood Elves.

#### Affiliation
Horde or independent. Most of the blood elves have joined the New Horde, invited to do so by the Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner.

#### Blood Elf Traits
Blood Elves are identical to High Elves in racial bonuses and names. 
<br><br>
***Blood Magic.*** This acts as High Magic. While you use abilities granted by this ability, your eyes glow a pale fel green instead of High Elves‘ blue. Instead of the prestidigitation cantrip, you may choose the thaumaturgy cantrip instead, and may cast the mana burn spell instead of mute. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:400px;'></div>

### Night Elf (Kaldorei)

*"The horn has sounded, and I have come as promised. I smell the stench of decay and corruption in our land. That angers me greatly."*
<br>
-- Malfurion Stormrage
<br><br>
As a night elf, you hail from Darnassus in Kalimdor. The race‘s prominent eyebrows, long pointed
ears and natural aspects imply a feral grace. Skin tones range from pale white to blue or even ruddy
red, and their hair ranges in color from bright white to woodland green to lustrous black.

#### Affiliation

***Alliance or independent.*** The night elves are members of the Alliance, but they are not the most trusted or highly regarded members of this group of races.<br>
Although honorable and just, the night elves‘ natural distrust has tainted their relations somewhat.<br>
Combined with their mystical appearances and mysterious natures, interactions with other races become uncomfortable at times. There is a strong streak of isolationism in the Kaldorei, for they are uncomfortable leaving the verdant mists of Teldrassil.

#### Night Elf Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Spirit score increases by 1.<br>
***Nature Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poisons, and have resistance against lightning and poison damage.<br>
***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.<br>
***Shadowmeld.*** When you are in dim or dark light, you gain advantage on Agility (Stealth) checks.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Ilthilior, Mellitharn, Khardona, Andissiel, Mardant, Tanavar.<br>
***Female Names.*** Keina, Deliantha, Meridia, Freja, Alannaria, Nevarial.<br>
***Family Names.*** Moonblade, Glaivestorm, Proudstrider, Oakwalker, Nightwing, Staghorn.

### Nightborne (Shal'dorei)

*“My people face a similar dilemma. I peered into all possible futures in search for an answer... and found only one.”*<br>
-- Elisande, Grand Magistrix of the Nightborne
<br><br>
As a Nightborne, you hail from the ancient city of Suramar, and have spent your life sheltered by the power of the Nightwell (a simulacrum of the Well of Eternity), and the dome of arcane power weaved by Elisande, the Grand Magistrix. The nightborne look similar to night elves, but their overall appearance is darker. Their skin does not have the brighter skin tones of purple and pink
that night elves do, instead having more pale skin with dark blue-purplish tones. A shal'dorei's hair is also far less colorful than the kal'dorei's, having only white, gray, black, or very pale-blue hair colors. Glowing tattoos seem common among nightborne, though whether these are cosmetic or a result of the Nightwell's energy is unknown. Their eyes glow a light blue.

#### Affiliation
***Horde or Independent.*** When the dome began unweaving after the Battle of Nighthold during the third Burning Legion invasion of Azeroth, the leaders of the Nightborne elected to let it fade, subjecting the Nightborne to the same withdrawal the High Elves face, rather than face the alternative. Electing to join the Horde, the Nightborne found new and steadfast allies in the Blood Elves when they re-appeared in the world of Azeroth. Nightborne that are more independentminded also roam the world, searching for ways to satiate their thirst for magic before it becomes an obsession like the Blood Elves.

#### Nightborne Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases<br> by 1.<br>
***Arcane Affinity.*** You have increased affinity with arcane magic. You can choose one of the
following two features:<br>
* *Augment Weave*. You deal one additional point of arcane damage for each damage dice with your arcane spells. This applies once per spell. You may apply this to spells that do not deal arcane damage, but only once per short or long rest.
* *Arcane Strike*. You can enhance your attacks with a blast of arcane damage. As a [strike] effect, you can add 1d6 points of arcane damage to your melee or ranged weapon attacks. For every four character levels you gain, you gain an additional dice of damage. You may choose to spend them all at once or one for each attack. You regain all spent dice at the end of a short rest.
* Energy Blast. You can release a blast of arcane force as if you possessed the Mystic Blast feat (arcane damage only). You may use this blast number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier before replenishing at a long rest. This deals a number of d4 dice equal to onequarter your level (minimum 1d4).
___
***Blessing of the Nightwell.*** You have resistance to arcane damage.<br>
***Nightfallen Magic.*** You know the mage hand cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a 1st level spell.

When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the arcane explosion spell as a 2nd level spell.

<br><br>
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these
abilities (even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities (and after using
them for one hour), your eyes glow a light blue.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level), they are always prepared
for free.<br>
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Ilthilior, Mellitharn, Lurunic, Elleshel, Mardant, Faldres.<br>
***Female Names.*** Kandui, Deliantha, Allainn, Freja, Alannaria, Macianne.<br>
***Family Names.*** Margaux, Babineaux, Gillette, Clarent, Roux, Prideux.

### Void Elf (Ren'dorei)
*"You have known the Shadow as nothing but horrors. The Shadow sees the Light in the same way. Neither
viewpoint is true. Neither is wrong."*<br>
-- Locus-Walker

As a void elf, you may be drawn from a small and elite cadre of high elven warriors, mages, and warlocks, or have come to learn the ways of the void by drawing upon void mana.

Void elves have extremely pale skin, blue eyes, and hair with varying shades of purple and blue - sometimes with tentacle-shaped dreadlocks. On occasion in combat they fully embrace the Void, shrouding their entire bodies in purple shadow magic (such as when using one of the racial traits).

Alleria Windrunner is the only elf shown to be able to keep the transformation indefinitely.

#### Affiliation
***Alliance or Independent.*** TODO - Description Missing

#### Void Elf Traits
***Chill of Night.*** You have resistance to shadow damage.<br>
***Preternatural Calm.*** You have advantage to all Stamina checks to concentrate on spells and other tasks.<br>
***Spatial Rift.*** You can create a spatial rift as a bonus action at any point you can both see and normally reach (by walking, climbing, or swimming) to within 30 feet (or your normal walk speed, whichever is higher).

\columnbreak

<br><br>

After the rift is set, you can teleport to it as a bonus action, it as if using the blink step spell. This is useable once per long rest, and acts as the spell for all other purposes. The rift remains up to 1 minute, and can be used so long as you are within 100 feet of it (so long as you placed it within the normal range beforehand).<br>
***Void Magic.*** You know the chill touch cantrip and can cast it normally (caster level equal to your character level). When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast detect magic as a 1st level spell. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the shadow word pain spell as a 2nd level spell. Charisma or Intelligence (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you use your mana pool for these abilities (even if you are not normally a spellcaster). While you use such abilities (and after
using them for one hour), your eyes glow a pale white.

If you can already cast such spells (and have a sufficiently high caster level), they are always prepared
for free.<br><br>
***Male and Female Names.*** Void elves follow the naming traditions of the high elven culture from which they were selected from<br>
***Family Names.*** Blackfeather, Duskblade, Shadowwalker, Swiftshadow, Velvetkind.

## Forsaken
*“We are the Forsaken. We will slaughter anyone who stands in our way”*<br>
-- Lady Sylvanas Windrunner”
<br><br>
Undead humans and elves freed from the Lich King‘s control during the second stage of the Third War, the Forsaken are a strange and dark force. Hailing from the twisted, skittering darkness of Undercity, the Forsaken are nominally allied with the Horde but serve only themselves. Their objectives are twofold: eliminate the Scourge, and establish a place for themselves on Azeroth.

Four years ago, the high elven Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner fell in combat against the Scourge. Prince Arthas raised her as a banshee and compelled her to follow his command. When the Lich King‘s power waned in the incidents surrounding the Frozen Throne, Sylvanas harnessed her fury and tore herself free from his skeletal grasp. She freed many other undead as well, and
recruited powerful allies from the Burning Legion and the surrounding ogre clans. Sylvanas dubbed her new force the Forsaken, and the undead established their capital in the labyrinthine crypts beneath Lordaeron‘s capital city. Their sprawling, subterranean realm is called Undercity.

As a forsaken undead, your alliance with the Horde started out as necessity and convenience, and your previous life bears witness to the many tragedies of Azeroth‘s reality. Needing both time and help to fight against their former Scourge masters, the Forsaken have a reputation of utter ruthlessness, human experimentation, and moral ambiguity.

<br><br>
<div style="margin-top:420px;"></div>

Although humans make the vast population of Forsaken, there is also a population of high elves
(usually becoming dark rangers), and other races, which leaves a lingering bit of their abilities.

### Affiliation
***Horde, or independent.*** Though the Forsaken do not trust anyone and no one trusts them, they are members of the Horde and, for now, do their best to help their allies and placate their ambassadors. Forsaken have even less love for the Alliance, particularly because they clash constantly with the human organization called the Scarlet Crusade. Some have thrown their lot with the Burning Legion, believing that only it is potent enough to defeat the Lich King.

### Forsaken Traits
***Size.*** Forsaken vary based on their original form before death - those who were medium before death are medium.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to dark crypts and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Cannibalize.*** You can consume the corpse of any natural creature. When you use this ability, you can spend hit dice to heal as if you completed a short rest. You can also mana siphon at the same time. Consuming a corpse takes 1 minute (instead of 1 hour for a short rest). You do not have the other benefits of rest, however (such as regaining ability uses). A natural creature may be fully

## Gnome
*“Up and away!”*
<br><br>
As one of the gnomish people of the Alliance, you are comfortable standing with your more physically and politically-apt allies to cover you as you go about your businesses. Proficient in the higher arts of engineering and arcana, gnomes are behind many developments in the intellectual and creative sides of the Alliance, creating spells, gadgets, and vehicles to propel their human, elven, and dwarven friends (as well as their new allies in the Alliance) to a better tomorrow.

### Affiliation
***Alliance.*** Gnomes are great friends of the Ironforge dwarves and have fought and died alongside human soldiers. They are wary of the high elves, but so is everyone else, so they don‘t feel too bad about that. They battled the Horde in the Second War and have a bit of a grudge against orcs, but gnomes are a kindly and forgiving lot and are willing to give the orcs a second chance.

Gnomes and goblins have always been rivals — though whether this rivalry is a friendly or brutal one depends on the individuals involved. Gnomes have not been on Kalimdor long enough to form proper opinions about its denizens. Tauren and night elves both seem rather rustic for gnome sensibilities — but they can make friends with anyone.

### Gnomish Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Stamina increases by 1.<br>
***Age.*** Adulthood at 40, can live up to be 500.<br>
***Size.*** Gnomes range from between 3 to 4 feet tall and average around 40 pounds. Your size is Small.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:560px;"></div>

***Darkvision.*** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Artificer’s Lore.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you have expertise instead of just proficiency.<br>
***Escape Artist.*** You have advantage on all saving throws to escape grapples, bonds, or other movement-restricting abilities or effects that hamper your freedom of movement.<br>
***Gnome Cunning.*** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Spirit, and Charisma saving throws against magic.<br>
***Natural Tinker.*** You have proficiency with Engineer‘s Tools, but it is treated as if your proficiency bonus is +1. If you later gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools by another way, you gain expertise in the skill instead.<br>
***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.<br>
***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarven script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Kiggle, Grobnick, Kazbo, Hagin, Snoonose.<br>
***Female Names.*** Beggra, Nefti, Sorassa, Gamash.<br>
***Family Names.*** Spinpistol, Airslicer, Bombtosser, Greatgear, Mekkatorque.

## Goblin
*“Time is money, friend!”*
<br><br>
Goblins value technology as a useful aspect of commerce. Some say that their advantage — and their curse — is to be the primary users of technology in a world governed by magic. While dwarves and gnomes share focused aspects of this gift, goblin technology is more far-reaching and sinister and makes a larger impact on the natural world, and mixes with alchemy in a gloriously unstable blend.

They employ vast teams of engineers and alchemists who expand on current technology and produce gadgets and potions to suit a wide array of applications. They constantly build and repair machines and work on new formulae. Unfortunately, goblins are both passionately genius yet suffer from undisciplined minds. Their lack of focus means that many creations end up half-finished as something else catches their attention.

Goblins hired themselves out to the Horde in the Second War, but now they belong only to themselves and whoever pays the most. Constantly building and inventing requires massive resources, both for creating the machines themselves and maintaining those that actually work.

Cannibalizing old machines only partially sustains this fervent activity of creation, so goblins rely on trade with as many races and cultures as possible. They are the quintessential merchants, peddling all manner of exotic goods for the highest possible prices.

As one of the goblin-folk, you have a reputation for money-grabbing, dishonest work, and unreliability, yet being loyal to money means you always have customers (and a place) in a war-torn world.

### Affiliation
***Independent or Horde.*** Goblin cartels serve as political bodies, and so far, the only cartel that chose to join the Horde was the Bilgewater cartel.

***Best Deals Anywhere.*** Anything you purchase costs 10% less, and anything you sell grants you 10% more of its value. You gain proficiency with the Charisma (Persuasion) skill.<br>
***Inured to Explosions.*** You have resistance to thunder damage.<br>
***Living Better.*** You can gain one of the below abilities.
* You gain proficiency with any two skills of your choice.
* You have proficiency with Engineer‘s Tools, but it is treated as if your proficiency bonus is +1. If you later gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools by another way, you gain expertise in the skill instead.

## Human
*“Go with honor, friend.”*<br><br>
Humans are among the youngest races on Azeroth, but they make up for it by being the most populous. With life spans generally shorter than the other races, humans strive all the harder to achieve great heights in empire building, exploration, and magical study. This aggressive and inquisitive nature leads the human nations to become active and influential in the world.

As a human, your people value virtue, honor, and courage, though like all races they also pursue power and wealth. Humans have spent generations battling dark forces and have lost some of their greatest kingdoms to them. This loss embitters humans, and they have a warlike view of diplomacy — swing first, ask questions later. Aided by belief in the Holy Light, humans have fought the hardest and endured the most during the wars against the Horde and the Burning Legion. You may hail from the ruins of once-glorious Lordaeron, the island-nation of Kul Tiras, the mountains of Alterac, the highlands of Stromgarde, or the rebuilt capital of Stormwind, amongst other nations.

Despite all their tragedies, humans remain hardy and brave — thoroughly committed to building strong societies, reinforcing their kingdoms and reclaiming their nations. Years of war have

### Affiliation
Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them. Most are loyal to the Grand Alliance, but there are pockets of independents, horde-allied, or even those tied to the Burning Legion or Scourge as demon-worshipping Warlocks and Scourge-following Necromancers, respectively.

### Human Traits

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>

***Human Spirit.*** You may grant yourself advantage to any one saving throw. After you use this ability, you can‘t use it again until you finish a short rest.<br>
***Skillful.*** You gain proficiency with one skill or tool of your choice. You may not choose Engineer‘s Tools or the Infusion Kit.<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elven musical expressions, Dwarven military phrases, and so on.<br><br>

## Orc
*“Lok'tar ogar!”*<br><br>
To their enemies, they are brutal and fearsome opponents, without parallel in their ferocity and cunning. To their allies, they are noble and honorable, following the traditions of a rediscovered past.

The orcs of Azeroth are part of a race that has once again found its true spirit, shunning the cruel practices of arcane and demonic magic for the paths of wisdom and power. Some orcs still hang on to the arcane practices of the past, but their time is fading.

The concept of honor pervades all echelons of orcish society. Even the naming of an orc is temporary until he has performed a rite of passage. Once an orc has brought honor to his name and the name of his clan, the elders give him a second name based upon his deed. For an orc, honor is as important as his clan, and most will die defending either clan or personal reputation. 

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:480px;"></div>

This is a new development for the orcs; before, when led by the forces tainted by the Burning Legion, the orcs were a bestial force barely controlled by demonic magic.

As one of the orcish people, you may hail from the exodus lead by Warchiefs Thrall and Grom Hellscream, and belong to the core tribes that form the new Horde, such as the Warsong Clan, Frostwolf, and Bleeding Hollow Clan, or you may belong to one of the sinister demon-worshipping tribes, such as the Laughing Skull or the Burning Blade Clans. Alternatively, you may belong to one of the clans who have never left their homeland of Draenor, such as the Mag‘har, who are brown in color. The greater the influence of fel on orcs, the brighter green their skin becomes. Some other clans have differently-colored skins, such as gray with yellow eyes (Dragonmaw Clan) or pale white (Shattered Hand Clan).

### Affiliation
***Horde.*** Thrall formed the Horde with determination and sheer will and created an alliance of races that has shaken the foundations of the world to its core. Having destroyed the legacy of Grom Hellscream by bringing the orcs out of the depths of demon worship and servitude to unseen powers, Thrall rules the Horde in Kalimdor with wisdom and temperance. The orcs are as much a part of the Horde as the Horde is part of what the orcs have become.

### Orcish Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Stamina increases by 1. You may also choose one third ability score and increase it by 1.<br>
***Age.*** Orcs mature and age a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around the age of 20 and rarely live up to be 100 years old.<br>

As a Pandaren, you are honorable and filled with a love of good company, good food – and every now and then, a good friendly brawl. The pandaren have been content to live in seclusion, allowing their culture to flourish and thrive away from the influence of the outside world.

However, every now and then, a pandaren is born with a thirst for adventure that rivals his or her thirst for a strong drink, and he or she strikes out to explore beyond Pandaria‘s shores. One of the most famous of such wanderers was the brewmaster Chen Stormstout, who set out looking for exotic ingredients for his special ale and wound up an integral part of the founding of the Horde. During the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when demons flooded onto Azeroth and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the last Emperor of the pandaren discovered a way to protect his land from devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left Pandaria haunted ever since.
As a Pandaren, you may have been one of the wanderers that left the misty island to explore the outside world and bring news back home.

Your allies might wonder from where you came and whether they could visit your home, you know that the mists shall only lift when the time is right.

### Affiliation
***Independent, Horde, or Alliance.*** Pandaren drift across affiliations, doing whatever they wish and making friends on either side.

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

## Tauren
*“Walk with the earth mother.”*<br><br>
The plains of Kalimdor have long been a home to these tremendous nomads. The tauren are a race of shamans, hunters and warriors who long ago developed a complex culture and system of living without the aid of stonework, steel or conquest. This is not to say that the tauren are a race of pacifists, for when they are angered they are capable of retaliating with swift and decisive brutality.
As a Tauren of Kalimdor, you prefer to act instead of talk, and seem to be brooding for most observers. Tauren rarely speak unless there is a true reason to, preferring to act instead of talk. However, once a tauren has learned to interact with a companion, there seems to be a more open and enthusiastic exchange of words.

### Affiliation
***Horde.*** When the tauren first encountered the orcs of Thrall‘s Horde, the tauren recognized the orcs as spiritual brethren. No other race shared such a similar outlook on the world, and the shamans of both races met frequently to discuss the matters of the spirit world. While the tauren see the orcs and trolls as potential friends to welcome, they rarely trust the Forsaken with more than a nod and a place to set their withered feet.

### Tauren Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Spirit and Stamina scores increase by 1 each.<br>
***Age.*** A Tauren typically claims adulthood around the age of 50 and can live to be 150 years old.<br>
***Size.*** Tauren are much larger than other races. Males average 7 1/2 feet tall and 400 pounds, while females are usually a bit shorter and lighter.

Tauren are mostly muscle, having incredibly developed physiques and brawny frames most suitable for combat. They are medium sized.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Endurance.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. You also have resistance against poison damage.<br>

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

***Gore.*** You can use an attack action to make a gore attack with your horns. It is a melee unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage plus your Strength modifier. If you used the Dash action before the attack (such as spending last round to approach or having the ability to use it as a bonus action), you may also use the Shove action. This is a strike effect.<br>
***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.<br>
***Plainswalker.*** Tauren can reach prodigious speed when continually moving. If you use the Dash action once per round for at least three rounds, you gather enough momentum to add a +10 bonus to your land speed, allowing you to travel as fast as a wolf (Speed 40). This bonus ends if you stop moving for any purpose. While benefitting from this speed, you are treated as if you are dashing for the purposes of the gore ability, and also have advantage to saving throws versus exhaustion from forced marches.<br>
***Self-Mastery.*** You have proficiency with one of the following skills and one of the following tools:
* Spirit (Nature) or Spirit (Perception)
* Mining tools or Herbalism kit
____
***Warstomp.*** You gain the Tremor talent as a 1st level warrior. If you later gain the talent, you can use the talent two additional times.<br>
***Languages.*** Common, Taur-ahe. The language of the tauren is often harsh and slow-sounding, which is reflected in the names of their children.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Azok, Bron, Turok, Garaddon, Hruon, Jeddek.<br>
***Female Names.*** Argo, Serga, Grenda, Beruna, Halfa.<br>
***Family Names.*** Darkthorn, Thunderhoof, Stormhorn, Quillsplitter, Stonebreaker, Plainstalker, Spiritwalker

## Troll
Several troll subspecies exist, and they are — almost universally – considered depraved by the civilized peoples of the world due to their brutality, cannibalistic ways, and use of dark magic. Jungle trolls are humanoids that live in Azeroth‘s wilderness, and Ice trolls are known as the descendants of a vicious civilization that (to this day) resists the Lich King‘s dominion in Northrend.

During Thrall‘s exodus from Lordaeron, the Horde rescued the Darkspear tribe, jungle trolls who lived on one of the many islands in the great sea from the mysterious Sea Witch. The Darkspear tribe owes Thrall and the orcs a great debt, and allied themselves with the Horde in gratitude. Their relationship with the noble orcs and tauren has begun to change the Darkspear trolls‘ dark ways. Jungle trolls are sly and cunning, and their society is tribal yet highly regimented.

Each tribe includes a chieftain, who is either the most powerful warrior in the tribe (called Shadow Hunters) or the most accomplished spellcaster (called Witch Doctors); the chieftain leads his soldiers in raids against other creatures.

As a troll, you are often viewed as vicious, brutal and evil, and history lends credence to this reputation. Waging constant wars against civilization and attempt to reclaim past glories is a fervent call for your people, who are seen (and commonly are) a lurking menace in any wilderness area

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:533px;"></div>

and willingly ally themselves with other dark powers to achieve their goals.

Darkspear trolls of the Horde, however, deny this legacy. The Horde has taught them camaraderie, restraint and, to a lesser extent, kindness. Zandalari trolls are also a new addition to the Horde, and unlike most trolls, they have a continuous unbroken legacy of civilization—the Empire of Zandalar, a political entity that stood since the War of the Ancients. This lends them great clout among the other trolls, making their empire act as mediator in inter-troll affairs or when times of great troubles arise.

### Affiliation
Troll affiliations are wildly different ever since the great Troll empires fell.
### Trollish Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 1 and your Stamina increases by 1. You may also choose one third ability score and increase it by 1.<br>
***Age.*** Trolls reach adulthood at the age of 18 and live up to be 80 years old.<br>
***Size.*** Trolls are larger and bulkier than humans, and they average around 7 feet tall and 200 pounds, although their lanky build and slouched pose undermines their height. Your size is Medium.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
***Darkvision.*** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Ancient Culture.*** You can gain one of the below abilities.
* *Berserker Warrior.* You can rage as if you had the berserker rage talent as a 1st level warrior. If you gain the talent, you increase the total times you can rage by 1. Your rage also increases the damage of ranged thrown attacks as if they were melee weapon attacks (so long as they use Strength).
* *Blessed by Loa.* You know the vicious mockery cantrip. If you have the ability to cast spells, this consumes mana as normal. Otherwise, it has no cost to use.
* *Naturally-Attuned.* You gain a favored terrain, as a 1st level hunter. If you ever become a hunter or gain a favored terrain, you may choose another while retaining this bonus.
____
***Rapid Regeneration.*** Whenever you rest or are subject to healing, you can roll twice and take the higher result of any roll to grant you hit points. If this dice has a special effect on a certain result (such as of the holy priest and paladins‘ Light‘s Insight ability), you may either choose to roll the healing twice or roll maximized dice, not both.
You can also regrow a lost limb after a week of losing them, unless the limb was lost through your own will or through magic, so long as you have adequate rest and satiation.<br>
***Keen Nose.*** You have advantage on all Spirit (Perception) tests related to smell.<br>
***Troll Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, and all weapons that have the thrown or ammunition properties, except firearms (unless proficient otherwise).<br>
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Troll.<br><br>
***Male Names.*** Drak, Gul, Zol, Vol, Ros, Mig, Gal, Doth, Mag, Ran, Vis.<br>
***Female Names***. Moor, Mesk, Dan, Mel, Shi, Mith, Hai, So, Lith, Arn, Din, Mak.<br>
***Family Names.*** Trolls usually employ titles rather than family names, but commonly take their tribe name as a family name.

### Subrace
Ancient divides among the troll-folk resulted in two main subraces: forest trolls, and ice trolls. Choose one of these subraces.

### Darkspear (Jungle Troll)
*“What‟cha want me do?”*<br><br>
As a jungle troll, you belong to the Darkspear tribe, the Zandalari, or their associates (such as most trolls who inhabit the isles of the Great Sea).

#### Affiliation
***Horde or Independent.*** Darkspear jungle trolls are steadfastly loyal to the orcs. Though they practice voodoo and many retain their savage natures, Thrall lets them live in his borders and generally do what they want. They feel a great debt to the orcs, and their time fighting alongside the tauren has made them friends of these creatures as well. They are suspicious of the Forsaken, but so is everyone else.

#### Darkspear Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 1.<br>
***Dark Promise.*** Jungle trolls have innate aptitudes that usually only show when they develop. Choose one of the below abilities:
* You have proficiency with Alchemist‘s Supplies and the Alchemy ability as a 1st level Alchemist. You have to store alchemical formula in a formula book, which you may start out with at 1st level. If you later gain Alchemy, you gain expertise in the skill instead.
* You gain proficiency with the Charisma (Intimidation) and Agility (Stealth) skills.

As an ice troll, you belong to the tribes in Northrend or high mountains in Azeroth (such as Khaz Modan), commonly the Drakkari or Frostmane tribe, respectively. Ice trolls average one foot taller than other trolls.

#### Affiliation

## Worgen
*“Get gabbin‟ or get going.”*<br><br>
The worgen's first verified appearance in the Eastern Kingdoms has been traced back to the Third War, when the archmage Arugal utilized the wolf-beasts as a weapon against the Scourge. Arugal's weapons soon turned against him, however, as the curse of the worgen rapidly spread among the human population, transforming ordinary men and women into ravenous, feral creatures. Arugal adopted many of the worgen as his own and retreated to the former mansion of Baron Silverlaine, the estate now known as Shadowfang Keep. The curse, however, was not contained. It persisted in the lands of Silverpine and extended even into the walled nation of Gilneas, where the curse rapidly reached pandemic levels.

The citizens of the human nation of Gilneas found themselves trapped, with no hope of escape. They retreated deeper within the isolated domain, and there they survived, fearful of the savage presence that lurked just outside the barricades. Tensions among the displaced citizens escalated over time, resulting in a civil war that now threatens to destabilize the embattled nation even more.
Records indicate that the worgen, a race of lupine humanoids, existed for a time in Kalimdor. Other evidence also suggested that the Worgen were from a different world that came through portals by Archmage Arugal. More recent evidence suggested that their true origin might have a connection to the night elves and a secretive druidic order from Kalimdor's distant past.

It was the night elves who (by happenstance) created the curse in the first place. Obligated to help their newfound allies, they re-introduced them to the Alliance.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:725px;"></div>

There are those among the Gilneans, however, who cling to hope. Many believe that a cure for the worgen curse may exist, although others have nearly given up, fearful that if they should lose hope, their humanity will be lost forever.

### Affiliation
Independent or Alliance. The Worgen of Gilneas re-joined their brethren of the Alliance once the Worgen Curse spread through their people, but in most cases, Worgen prefer to cater to their own hungers and ambitions.

### Worgen Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Agility score increases by 2 and your Strength score increases by 1.<br>
***Age.*** As humans.<br>
***Size.*** Worgens are about the same size as humans when in humanoid and Worgen form. Your size is Medium.<br>
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Your curse grants you the ability to see in dark conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
***Aberration.*** You have advantage to saves against poisons and resistance against poison damage.<br>
***Worgen Form.*** On your turn, you can shift from human form to worgen form as an action. Shifting lasts until you end it on your turn as a bonus action. You also gain the features described below.
* You can roll a 1d6 dice for your unarmed attack when you bite (piercing damage), and a 1d4 for your unarmed attack if you use your claws (slashing damage). These can replace your original human natural attacks.
* You can use the Dash action as a bonus action. 
* Any attack you make with your claw can grapple a target if they are your size or smaller.
* Your natural weapon dice increases in strength as if you were a monk equal to your level for your claw attack, or a monk four levels higher for your bite attack (up to a maximum of 2d6 damage if at level 17 or above). For example, a 7th level Worgen warrior‘s claws deal 1d6 damage (from 1d4), and their bite deals 1d8 damage.
* If you have a magic weapon, you can fold its power into your form while you are shifting. While shifted, you cannot use the magic weapon, but can treat your unarmed attacks as if magical.
Worgen Curse. Depending on your mental acuity, willpower, or predilections in combat, the curse is either a major or minor part of your identity. You can modify your Worgen Form ability with one of the following modifiers.
* Embrace the Beast. The curse more heavily affects your body than your mind or abilities of perception. You can shift as a bonus action instead of an action. While shifting, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Stamina modifier (minimum of +1), although you can only gain temporary hit points once per long rest, regardless of how many times you shift to worgen form.
Furthermore, when you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike with your natural weapon on your turn, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with your claws, you can also make an unarmed strike (bite) as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
* Reject the Beast. The curse more heavily affects your mind and spirit, enhancing your abilities to track and perceive, but is unable to fully take hold of you. At the end of a long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level. When you are in Worgen Form, these temporary hit points are suppressed, but you gain keen senses, and have advantage on Perception checks that involve scent. You are also proficient in the Insight and Perception skills, and gain expertise in one of them if you are already proficient in both.
Lastly, so long as you are not shifting, you have advantage to contested checks to track (as if you had the Favored Enemy ability, but not restricted to a creature type).
___
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.
<br><br>
***Names*** Worgen names follow the same conventions as human names.

## Special: Half-breed Race
The Warcraft universe also has its share of mixed-origin characters (or half races), most commonly half-elves (human and elves of any type), half-orcs (human and orcs, or draenei and orcs), and half-ogres (orcs and ogres). Some of the more famous examples are Garona Halforcen and the half-elven Alodi, the first Guardian.
Mixed races are treated as both races with spells, magic effects, and mechanical purposes, but may be looked down upon by their parent races.

### Affiliation
The creature usually either falls to either parents' affiliation or is independent.

### Half-breed Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** The creature chooses one of either parents' racial attributes.<br>
***Size.*** The creature is the average in size of both parents (if they are not both Medium sized).<br>
***Speed.*** The creature moves at an average of both parents (if they are not both 30 ft.)<br>
***Racial traits.*** The creature chooses one of either parents' racial traits.<br>
***Racial penalties.*** The creature takes all racial penalties of both parents (if present, such as blood elves‘ mana addiction).<br>
***Languages.*** The creature gains the languages of both parents.<br><br>
***Names.*** Follows the naming conventions of both parents or may be wholly original. Usually, mixed creatures are titled by their ancestry, such as 'Halforcen,' 'half elven', or even 'half human' depending on their actions and history.

### Example
For example, Drann Halforcen, (orc father, draenei mother) can choose his father's (+2 to Strength, +1 to Stamina) or his mother's (+2 to Strength, +1 to Spirit) racial attribute bonuses. The character may then make a decision on which race is he closer biologically to (gaining all Draenei racial traits if the maternal side is dominant, or all Orc traits if their paternal side is dominant).

He would gain both Common, Orcish, and uncorrupted Eredun in either case.

\pagebreakNum

# Chapter 3: Classes
Specializations in Warcraft act as sub-classes for most intents and purposes. Some subclasses are
racially-locked, and thus can only be entered by fulfilling a racial requirement.
Classes in Azeroth have different names (as noted in the introduction), and sometimes different
abilities. These are noted below.

## Optional Rule: More Talent

Talents allows customizing your character in a more freeform way than multiclassing.

With this optional rule, you may exchange class features gained from archetypes (paths, circles, traditions, etc.) to grant access to a talent, but only if the class already has the ability to gain talents,
and only once per level.

## Alchemist (ALC)
*A forsaken stalks the ruins of a murloc village, picking eyes and bits of flesh. As a skulking murloc prepares to jump out at her, she casually tosses a potion at its chest without glancing at it, causing the skin to bubble and blacken with a terrible—the last thing it sees are the forsaken‘s fingers reaching forward to take out its light.
<br><br>
A gnome reaches down to his box of Alchemist‘s Supplies, picking a rare herb and some pinches of sea salt, before tossing them into a small battle-beaker warmed by a portable burner. With uncanny calm, he weighs the curative mixture, before delivering it to a dying friend, revivifying her.
<br><br>
Laughing maniacally as he consumes his potion, the troll rushes into the fight, fingertips mutating into razor-sharp claws. As his muscles grow larger, and as his skin hardens, his eyes gleam with the promise of pain.
<br><br>
A goblin mercenary sits on the back of a drugged ogre, tossing explosive potions. Wincing as a human warrior stabs his giant homunculus, he pulls out a potion from his side pouch and jams it down the ogre‘s throat. The crunch of teeth against glass invigorates the ogre, and, with a burp, it tosses its arm forward with great strength, tossing the human away as the alchemist laughs in triumph.*
<br><br>
Whether by careful measuring, self-experimentation, explosive mixtures, or supportive potions, an alchemist utilizes their own mix of magic and science, alchemical science, to support and heal wounds, decimate enemies, manifest unusual effects, or augment themselves to wade into battle. 

These lightly armored individuals are experts in creating a variety of special effects, from temporary explosives to elixirs that revive the dead.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:425px;"></div>

### Magic and Science
In the Warcraft universe, alchemy is not merely pseudo-chemistry—it is an art that draws power from the primal elements of life, not unlike actual magic. An alchemist is a master of the art who takes it leaps and bounds further than their peers, who are limited in their alchemical products to mere healing poultices and anti-toxins, reaching heights of reviving the dead or manifesting massive explosives.

The greatest strength of an alchemist is their versatility. They can themselves adequately but can specialize in being battle-chemists who augment themselves with potions before tearing their enemies apart with their own hands. They can choose to focus on the augmentative powers of their mixtures, delaying harm and healing wounds, or to debilitate their enemies with negative status effects. Damage dealt by an alchemist‘s potions usually focus on concussive or poison damage, but they are also broad in scope, dealing fire or frost or lighting as required of them. The better they anticipate their opposition, the better the alchemist can prepare. 

The success of alchemists relies greatly on the formulae and recipes they have in their formula books. They gain new formulae as they gain experience, study other formula books, or research independently.

### The Weight of Knowledge
Alchemists‘ lives may appear mundane, starting as a sage, independent researcher under a mage tower, a plague researcher, or member of a military force‘s supply chain. Other alchemists focus on trade, opening alchemy shops and selling anything from curative mixtures to love potions. Others still have adapted their talents to violence, such as serving in mercenary forces or the military, sapping structural defenses and focusing on combat support.

The weight of knowledge and the demand for versatile potions calls for even the most sedentary alchemists to venture out to investigate strange happenings, support their friends, or answer the call to heroism.

\pagebreakNum

Alchemists are students, researchers, and scientists of the mysterious science of alchemy.

To choose to alchemist class is to be more than a dabbler in the art of alchemy—they are utilizers of strange techniques that would empower themselves and their allies, experienced craftspeople who can make potions for fractions of the normal time and cost, and some have even modified their bodies to make full use of their skills.

Creating poisons, potions, special explosives, and empowering substances, alchemists are either curiosities, prized members of society, or reclusive, feared experts in unstable weird sciences.

Alchemy itself does not fall strictly in one end between science and magic, but is a potent force nonetheless.

Alchemists support soldiers and adventurers, and could easily take to the field themselves, brewing and concocting potions, poisons, and poultices to support (or create) allies on the field. Some work to support their communities, others attempt to replicate (or surpass) the work of the Scourge's necromancers, and others focus on self-empowering through strange concoctions they imbibe.

### Creating an Alchemist
As you make your alchemist character, consider the origins of their knowledge: were they selftaught, a student of another alchemist, or did they gain this mastery by esoteric means? Alchemy is a difficult discipline—how did you accomplish the challenge to gain your status? Were you motivated by war, fortune, or by something else entirely, such as the lack of magical talent to become a spellcaster?

Perhaps you preferred the reliable mundane science of alchemy over the unexpected extraordinary power of magic, or took comfort in the fact that you were in demand in an urban setting—there is no lack of adventurers who might need your aid as an alchemist if you do not wish to go out and adventure. Do you have any peers among alchemists? Do they perceive your approach to science as calm and intellectual, or rash but with great breakthroughs or a dangerous form of meddling with life and death that should not be tolerated? Do you have a special ambition or goal to achieve as an alchemist—such as making magic-like effects accessible to the mundane public, providing affordable healing, and counters to common ailments, or are your creations for your own monetary benefit?

#### Quick Build
You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score. Make Agility your next-highest if you want to use ranged or finesse weapons, or focus on throwing potions and explosives. Use Strength instead if you wish to empower yourself in
battle and engage in combat via the mutate spell.

Second, choose the guild artisan or scholar backgrounds. Third, choose the noxious fumes (poison spray), minor alchemy, and fire bolt cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your formula book: burning hands, explosion, mutate, and rejuvenation.

### Class Features
As an alchemist, you gain the following class features
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per alchemist level

\pagebreakNum

#### Alchemy
When starting with this class, you have proficiency with Alchemist‘s Supplies and can use them with uncanny skill. You can create alchemical mixtures from any spell that belongs to the alchemist spell list, so long as you have the alchemical formula. This does not allow you to cast spells, only to know them enough to create potions. Each level in the alchemist class provides you with 1 caster level to access alchemical formulae, as appropriate to the alchemist spell list.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus. As normal for alchemist spells, you cannot cast them, but can turn them into potions. Cantrips do not require a formula book, and are always memorized.

##### Conjuring and Binding
An alchemist can conjure and bind aberrations, constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead, as well homunculi creatures (creatures with the homunculus template). 

This is usually done by crafting miniature versions and preparing them in potions or globes of alchemical mixtures.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each alchemist level provides you with one caster level in the alchemist class (minimum 1). You follow the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section). You may not prepare spells, but can brew them into potions, so long as you have your formulae book or have memorized the formula.

When you level up, you can exchange a spell known with another you qualify for. You cannot otherwise change your alchemist spells other than by leveling up and exchanging them, or by training under another alchemist, fiend, celestial, or undead creature (see tutorship under magic).

##### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your alchemist spells and abilities, since your powers draw upon your scientific prowess. You use your Intelligence modifier whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an alchemist effect you create and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 

your Intelligence modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + 

your Intelligence modifier

##### Spellbook – Formula Book
At 1st level, your formula book contains four 1st-level alchemist spells of your choice. When you level up, you gain 2 additional alchemist spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research, tutelage, or by deriving formulae from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spell versions of the formulae on your spell list.

Your formula book is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by studying with it and replicating experiments found in other formula books.

#### Inurement
You also gain the ability to craft temporary and unstable alchemical creations at certain levels. Such creations have limitations compared to normal crafting (as described in Chapter 7), but are more accessible and useable in combat.

\columnbreak

You also need the required tools at hand (Alchemist‘s Supplies).

Creating temporary alchemical creations costs an Action if a Consumable, or 1 minute if a Creature (such as an alchemical homunculus or an Ooze).

| Level  | Rarity | Point Cost<sup>1</sup> | Material Cost<sup>2</sup> |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
| 1 | Common | 5 | 1 gp<sup>3</sup> |
| 1 | Uncommon | 7 | 4 gp |
| 5 | Rare | 9 | 16 gp |
| 9 | Epic | 11 | 64 gp |
| 13 | Legendary | 13 | 256 gp |
| 17 | Artifact | 15 | 1,024 gp |


<sup>1</sup> You reduce the crafting point cost by your proficiency bonus. You may reduce the point cost by your proficiency bonus (not applied above). Common items can have their point cost reduced to 0.

<sup>2</sup> The crafting cost is unaffected by the Efficient Alchemy feature. Unlike normal crafting, the base crafting cost in materials is not modified for crafting class (x25 for Creatures), and thus innovating a Consumable costs the same as a Creature.

<sup>3</sup> Starting at 5th level, your Common-level temporary creations do not consume crafting materials, but still require access to your tools (Alchemist‘s Supplies).

##### Crafting Point Cost
Your ability to do such rapid and innovative creations strains your mind and creative capabilities.

You are afforded a pool of Crafting Points (which act as Mana Points). Similarly to Mana Points, you spend points to spontaneously craft items and regain such points by resting. This is subject to the following points of difference, however:
* You have a number of Crafting Points equal to your Intelligence score (not modifier) plus your proficiency bonus plus one-half your Alchemist level (round down). Unlike mana points, your pool is unaffected by the spell level you can access. As this power is not magical in nature, you are unaffected by any anti-magic effects such as an antimagic field or mana burn effects.
* You do not regain points by mana-restorative effects, such as Mana Potions or resting near mana fountains. However, so long as you are in a relevant resource node or crafting area (such as an alchemical grove or your stronghold), you regain points with a +50% increase, as you draw inspiration from them.
* Your creation costs scale by the item‘s rarity and your ability to craft them; and are thus limited by the Rarity column in your class chart. You can craft anything you have memorized or if you refer to the formula of in your possession (such as in your formulae book).
____
A temporary creation that breaks down, fails, or expires can be harvested for one-half of the crafting
materials invested. This does not apply to Consumables that were successfully used.
Your temporary creations can be made permanent by paying the rest of the crafting cost.

##### Material Cost
As well as consuming Crafting Points, temporary creations also cost material costs appropriate to their rarity, as detailed above.

\pagebreakNum

##### Temporary Item Duration
Once created, the temporary item remains until used (if a Consumable), until it breaks down (if a Creature), or up to 5 minutes.

Temporary creations are not stable, and if the item is not a consumable in nature, you must succeed on a tool check (Alchemist‘s Supplies) against a DC of 15 after 1 minute (if a Creature), or the creation breaks down.

If the item is not being used by you (or a creature bound to you), it has a 50% failure rate. You may maintain multiple temporary creations, but they all begin expiring starting from the round they were crafted.

##### At Higher Levels
As you increase in levels, creations of certain rarity require less time and effort. The time it takes for you to inure or craft temporary versions of your creations is reduced to a Bonus Action or 3 turns at the following levels for each rarity.

| Level | Rarity | Consumable | Creature |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
| 2nd | Common | Bonus Action | 3 turns |
| 9th | Uncommon | Bonus Action | 3 turns |
| 17th | Rare | Bonus Action | 3 turns |

#### Weird Science

Also at 1st level, you may choose a weird science or avenue of natural talent to focus your alchemical powers upon. Choose one of the following choices:
* *Homunculus.* You gain a companion that is a humanoid, undead, construct, or any creature with the homunculus template. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/2 or lower. See Bound Companions for more details. Your homunculus companion improves in CR the higher your level becomes, CR equal to 1 per every 8 levels of Alchemist (improving to 1 CR at level 4, 2 CR at level 8, and 3 CR at level 16). This either takes the form of choosing a higher-level companion, or adding hit dice to the companion until its CR increases.
If a humanoid or a creature with the homunculus template, the creature is loyal to you, but retains a shadow of free will. It can be commanded to go against its nature (or what it perceives as its nature) with a DC 15 Charisma check. Bonding with a homunculus requires spending one hour communicating with the creature by means it can understand, and spending the next seven hours in bonding activities (fixing/healing/conversing/etc.). The companion can use your potions as if it was you.
* *Innate Cantrips.* You can use any cantrips you have learned, so long as you have access to your Formula Book. You can use cantrips as if you were a spellcaster, and do not need to turn them into potions or use any resources on them (such as mana or inurement).
* *Potion Slinger.* You may choose one type of ranged weapon (such as crossbows or bows) and gain proficiency if you don‘t already have it. Furthermore, you may spend a potion to infuse the projectile with the potion‘s effects. You may choose to activate the potion before launching the projectile (to take into account the spell‘s original casting time), but the spell otherwise takes place as if the target was hit (or the area it landed on) is the spell‘s original target. You may choose to deal the ranged weapon‘s damage on impact or to only apply the potion‘s effect. 
* *Mithridatism.* You gain innate power over poisons. You naturally generate up to four doses of basic poison (as described in the Player‘s Handbook) whenever you complete a long rest. The poison‘s DC is equal to your Alchemy Spell Save DC, however, and the damage is equal to 1d4 Poison damage per Alchemist spell level you can access. The poison expires before you complete your next long rest, replenishing your store. If you have an empty Mithridatism dose slot, you can choose to fill it with a poison you are affected by, so long as you succeed on the saving throw against it and are aware of its presence. You can store this poison for future use, but cannot otherwise generate it.
You also have skill in deploying poisons that are in your dosage slots, and gain temporary immunity to such poisons so long as they are not deployed. You may deploy poisons as described under Chapter 7: Poisoner‘s Kit.  

#### Efficient Alchemy
Starting at 2nd level, your ability to whip up potions increases your efficiency in creating normal potions. You reduce the base crafting cost for potions from one-half to one-quarter buying price.
This does not affect the costs of material components for spells nor does it affect the crafting costs for your Inurement ability. Normally crafting a potion is also one step of complexity faster. This does not also reduce the cost of spell material components.

Starting at 13th level, this ability also halves the cost of spell material components.

#### Alchemy Path
When you reach 3rd level, you walk a path that defines you as your path of alchemy. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to a path but not yet fully enveloped in it.

Now you choose the Path of the Mutant for self-transmutation and improving your combat abilities, Path of the Transmutor for theoretical pursuits and advanced alchemical effects, or Path of the Apothecary to go beyond morality and mortality and dabble in death and life magics, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Those features include path spells.

##### Path Spells
Each path has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the path description. Once you gain access to a path spell, you always have it known and memorized.

Path spells do not need to be stored in the alchemical notebook.

If you gain a path spell that doesn‘t appear on the alchemist spell list, the spell is nonetheless an
alchemist spell for you.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.


#### Empowered Physique
Starting at 5th level, you do not automatically incur miscibility when using potions within 1 hour of one another. 

\pagebreakNum

You may benefit from a number of potions at a given time equal to 1 + your
Stamina modifier (minimum 1) without risking miscibility.

You may, when drinking a new potion, choose to cause it to interact with another potion you
already drank, provoking miscibility.

#### Mettle
Starting at 7th level, your exposure and experimentations in alchemy left your body more resilient to certain effects, such as a rogue‘s poison gas or a stinking cloud spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Stamina saving throw to take only half damage or a reduced effect, you instead take no damage or effect if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage (or the reduced effect) if you fail.

For example, a clay golem‘s reduction to maximum hit points is negated on a successful saving throw, and you take half the effect if you fail.

#### Favored Potions
Starting at 9th level, you gain increased proficiency in inuring potions. Choose up to four potions.

These potions have half the Crafting Point cost, and their formulae are memorized. Furthermore, whenever you roll for miscibility with one of these potions, you can roll twice and take the better result

You may change a single favored potion with one week of downtime.

#### Scavenge
Starting at 10th level, when you gather raw materials for use with alchemy, you gain triple the total value. This applies when harvesting existing devices, nodes, creatures, and dismantling potions.

#### Expert Chemist
Starting at 11th level, whenever you deliver a poison, disease, or potion, you increase the DC, damage, or duration of the effect increases by 2 points or two rounds (if possible).

#### Internal Clock
Starting at 15th level, whenever you make a potion and consume it, you can choose to keep its effects latent until a condition you specify. When said condition comes to pass, the potion activates as if you just consumed it, and costs you a reaction.

You can have a number of potions stored this way equal to your proficiency bonus. If the potion has a casting time of more than 1 Action, it must remain latent for a minimum duration equal to the casting time first. These potions do not incur miscibility, even if consumed at the same time.

Starting at 18th level, activating a potion on your internal clock costs no reaction.

#### Adaptable Inurement
Starting at 17th level, you can utilize a sample or body part of a creature and mix it into a potion as a Bonus Action, inuring the target to it. If inured this way, the target can use your temporary potion as if it were you. This includes anything from hair, a bit of skin, saliva, blood, or nails.

Furthermore, whenever it uses a potion inured to it, it can roll twice and choose the result when miscibility is rolled.

You are always counted as if you are inured to your own potions. If you could already roll twice on miscibility, you can roll three times instead.

\columnbreak

#### Synthesized Potions
Starting at 20th level, you can create synthesized potions. A synthesized potion has the benefit of one potion of a specific rarity, and includes the effect of another potion of a rarity two steps below.

This does not risk miscibility.

For example, the rare-quality Globe of Invulnerability Potion can be synthesized with a Commonquality Healing Potion. This costs the normal cost of the potion plus half the cost of the secondary potion.

You can possess an indefinite number of synthesized potions, but create only one every 24 hours.

### Path of the Apothecary
You recognize no boundary of morality or faith in your pursuit of weird science. Reaching beyond the realms of experimention to dissect the supernatural, you employ necromancy, soul magic, and unusual diseases and poisons. Apothecaries usually dress as plague doctors or experimenters, dealing with death and strange occult things for reasons only they know.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Apothecary Path Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Conjure undead (animate undead), curse of agony |
| 5th | Rune array (vampiric), ray of enfeeblement |
| 9th | Feign death, stinking cloud |
| 13th | Confusion, cripple |
| 17th | Contagion, flesh to stone |

</div>

#### Plague Zombies
Upon gaining this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to imbue any undead creature you create or control by your potions with any one poison or disease you have.

You may imbue any corporeal undead with up to three dosages of a poison or disease, and allowing the creature to act as a carrier. It can then apply the poison, depending on the poison‘s vector, as below:
* A dose of an inhaled poison or disease can be exhaled as an action, affecting creatures within 5 feet (plus 5 feet per size category above Medium).
* A dose of a contact poison or disease can be delivered with a successful melee weapon attack that inflicts the disease. The attacker cannot add their ability modifier to damage for this attack.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:330px;"></div>

* A dose of an ingested poison or disease can be projected onto edible food or drink as an action.
* A dose of an injury poison or disease can be delivered with a successful attack; one dose is delivered with each successful attack.

If you also chose the Mithridatism Weird Science feature, you can choose for some of your creations to host your doses instead of you.

#### Repair Flesh
Also starting at 3rd level, your alchemist spells and potions that heal the living on your spell list can heal undead and constructs (such as rejuvenation and heal). A given creature must be studied for at least one hour before you may adapt your alchemy to heal them, however. For instance, studying a forsaken for one hour allows you to heal all forsaken with the holy light spell if
manifested as an alchemist spell (or potion).

#### Necromantic Mastery
Starting at 6th level, you add all spells of the Necromancy school from the Mage spell list to the Alchemist spell list, and can make potions out of them.

#### Biohazard
Starting at 10th level, you gain the Mithridatism Weird Science feature if you didn‘t choose it at level 1.

If you already have the feature, it is instead enhanced as follows:
* You have a maximum of 8 poison doses instead of 4, and you regain 2 doses when you complete a short rest.
* The poison DC is increased by 2.
* Gaining acquired immunity to poisons or diseases requires only one-quarter the normal time. See the Poisoner‘s Kit for the ability to gain immunities against diseases or poisons.

#### Soul Science
Starting at 14th level, whenever you create or summon undead, homunculi, or constructs via alchemy (as with the conjure spell), you may grant the creature Blindsight against living and undead creatures, as well as constructs and devices that work off an electrical source. The Blindsight only works up to 60 feet, but the creature is not blind beyond that radius.

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

### Path of the Mutant
You push your body past the normal limit—mutation is no mere rage or chemical reaction; it is a secret science only you know. Mutants are often ostracized by society, which sees such unstable people to be dangerous and fickle in their moods.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Mutant Path Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Absorb elements, mage armor |
| 5th | Alter self, berserker rage |
| 9th | Fly, gaseous form |
| 13th | Cripple, stoneskin |
| 17th | Flesh to stone, true seeing |

</div>

##### Greater Mutate
Upon gaining this archetype at 3rd level, you treat any mutate spell you benefit from as if it were heightened one level for no cost, allowing certain mutations to become stronger.

You always have the mutate spell memorized.

Furthermore, while under the effects of the spell, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls. This bonus also applies to any homunculus you have.

Lastly, you also gain proficiency in Strength saving throws.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

##### Mutate Potion
Also starting at 3rd level, you can spend 4 Crafting Points to change any potion you have into the rejuvenation spell of the same spell level (up to the maximum spell level of the spell you can access). You memorize the rejuvenation spell.

##### Super Mutant
Starting at 6th level, whenever you are under the effects of the mutate spell, you gain 1d6 temporary Hit Points per step of rarity (1d6 Common, 2d6 Uncommon, etc.). These fade at the end of the spell‘s duration.

Furthermore, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Lastly, you no longer gain exhaustion from the berserker rage spell, and you do not lose your action when the haste spell ends for you.

##### Battle Chemist
Starting on 10th level, you gain the Flash Bomber talent. These uses stack with the Weird Science feature (if you already chose it).
Also, whenever you are in the area of effect of the explosion spell (regardless of origin), you can benefit from the berserker rage spell for 3 rounds.

##### Greater Internal Clock
Starting at 14th level, you treat your proficiency bonus as if 2 points higher for the purposes of how many potions you can have active under your Internal Clock ability.

Also, if your Internal Clock ability would activate, you may choose to withhold benefitting from it up to 1 minute. If you do not declare a use of the ability (reaction if not in your turn, bonus action if it is) it fades at the end of the duration.

<div style="margin-top:230px;"></div>


### Path of the<br> Transmutor
Whereas the apothecary dabbles with the line between life and death, and the mutant experiments on themselves, you handle alchemy as a science and a tool, and are considered a more ‗classical‘ alchemist. Transmutors are appreciated in societies, often serving in courts or in magical circles to quantify the true nature of alchemy, sicknesses, and magic. In adventuring parties, they often focus on support.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Transmutor Path Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Fog cloud, holy light |
| 5th | Create food and water, see invisibility |
| 9th | Haste, revivify |
| 13th | Polymorph, resilient sphere |
| 17th | Modify memory, telepathic bond |

</div>

##### Fortifying Chemistry
Upon gaining this archetype at 3rd level, you may enhance any potion you handle for at least 1 minute to grant the imbiber temporary hit points equal to your alchemist level.

These hit points remain for 1 hour, and can stack, but cannot exceed double the target‘s maximum hit points.

##### Medical Expert
Also starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with an Herbalism Kit and the Spirit (Medicine) skill, if you didn‘t already have proficiency. Furthermore, whenever you expend a use of a Healer‘s Kit as an action to treat a creature, the target can expend one hit dice. A creature can benefit from this ability once per short rest.

Whenever you expend a use of a Healer‘s Kit, you can roll a DC 20 Intelligence check with Alchemist Supplies. If you succeed, you do not expend a single use of the kit.

##### Secrets of Alchemy
Starting at 6th level, you learn and memorize how to create a Philosopher‘s Stone and the transmute material spell. You can transmute a mineral once per short rest instead of once per long rest, and you further memorize the alchemical composition of two minerals (as recipes), allowing you to


\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:280px;"></div>

turn one mineral to another. Whenever you would gain an alchemical recipe from leveling up, you may choose a mineral recipe instead.

##### Augmentation
Upon reaching 10th level, you can augment a potion you hold by spending 1 minute or an Bonus Action and 4 Crafting Points. An augmented potion remains augmented indefinitely, but you can only have up to one potion augmented at any given time. You can apply the following augmentations:
* Every dice your potion rolls is maximized.
* Every dice your potion rolls is minimized (lowest result on the roll).
* When the potion is used, roll a d100. On a result of 50 or higher, the potion gives its full effects with only a fraction of the actual content, allowing the potion to be reused.
* You alter your potion to activate in response to a trigger you choose and that can affect the potion‘s contents, such as time passed, being shaken a certain way, or being touched by an eligible target. This does not stack with the Internal Clock feature.
For instance, if you can create an exorcism potion, you can coat a sword with it to activate in response to touching an eligible target of the spell, or to activate after 1 minute to counter a possible possession.

##### Greater Augmentation
Upon reaching 16th level, you can augment up to three potions at any given time. You can also apply the following additional augmentations:
* Your potion also has the effects of a dispel magic or mana burn spell, with the spell level two spell levels lower than the potion‘s original spell level (minimum 1). If the potion has no replicated spell level, the effective level is instead equal to the lowest spell level the spell can be cast.
* Your potion also has the benefits of one of the following spells: protection from poison, protection from energy, or remove curse.
* Your potion allows the target to add their proficiency bonus to one saving throw of their choice. They cannot apply this to a saving throw in which they are already proficient. This remains up to 1 hour.
* Your potion has a 25% chance to enhance the imbiber with increased lifeforce. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or dies within 4 hours of imbibing the potion, they are affected with the revivify spell. The potion must replicate a spell level of 6 or higher to gain this augmentation.

## Death Knight (DKN)
*Clad in armor streaked with warm blood, the human‘s eyes
glow in a cold blue light as he swings his greatsword with
precise fury, keep foes occupied with him. As he does so, his
allies around him watch as his wounds seem to heal by
vampiric-like magic even as the enemy falls.*
<br><br>
*Standing tall against the oncoming horde, a blood elf
embraces the frozen resolve within to shrug off her enemies‘
attacks. Imbuing her twin shortswords with the power of the
frozen north, her attacks break through their armor with
reckless abandon, sending icy bits of armor, bone, and flesh flying.*
<br><br>
*A dwarf gazes over the battlefield alone, remembering a past life when he commanded legions of
his brethren to defend their homelands. No longer the same dwarf, he raises his hand, binding the
corpses to undeath, once more in the position of command, old loyalties broken in death.*

Years after the destruction of Draenor, the immensely powerful Lich King created a new breed of
death knights: malevolent, rune-wielding warriors of the Scourge. The first and greatest of these was
the Lich King's chosen champion, Prince Arthas Menethil. Once a mighty paladin of the Silver
Hand, the prince sacrificed his soul to claim the runeblade Frostmourne in a desperate bid to save
his people, and having his soul bound for eternal servitude under the Lich King. The rest are
primarily made up of other fallen paladins whose souls were twisted and bound to the will of the
Frozen Throne.

Like Gul'dan's death knights, these dark champions possess unholy strength; they, however, do not
possess free will and their minds are inexorably entwined with and 

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

dominated by the Lich King's vast consciousness.

Despite the potential loss of free will, some powerful mortals are intrigued by
the promise of immortality and pledge their souls freely into the Lich King's service to achieve it.

In the years since Arthas shattered the Frozen Throne and merged with the Lich King, the power
and fury of the death knights has only grown. Now these unrelenting crusaders of the damned
eagerly await the Lich King's command to unleash their fury on Azeroth once again.

Unlike death knights of the Old Horde, the Scourge's death knights are not limited to their use of
ranged spell casting abilities. In addition, these tireless death knights are considerably stronger,
faster, and more agile than they were in life. However, both generations are equally destructive and
terrifying to engage in the field of battle.

### Fallen Protectors
Most death knights were once virtuous defenders of humanity and truth as paladins. However,
once the paladin ranks were disbanded by the failing Alliance, many of these holy warriors traveled
to the quarantined lands to ease the suffering of those left within the plague-ridden colonies.

Though the paladins were resistant to disease, they were persecuted by the general populace who
believed that they had been infected by the foul plague. A small band of paladins, embittered by
society's cruelty, traveled north to find the plague's source. These renegade knights succumbed to
bitter hatred over the course of their grueling quest.

When they finally reached Ner'zhul's icy fortress in Northrend they had become dark and
brooding. The Lich King offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty. The
weary, vengeful warriors accepted his dark pact, 
and although they retained their humanity, their
twisted souls were bound to his evil
 will for all time. 

\pagebreakNum

Bestowed with black, vampiric Runeblades and
shadowy steeds, death knights serve as the Scourge's mightiest generals.

### Release from Service
When the Lich King's control of his death knights was broken, his former champions sought
revenge for the horrors committed under his command. After their vengeance was won, the death
knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the
land of the living in search of a new purpose.

The Knights of the Ebon Blade is a faction consisting of the renegade death knights that broke free
of the Lich King's control after the battle of Light's Hope Chapel. Led by Highlord Darion
Mograine, the Knights of the Ebon Blade have allied themselves with the Alliance and the Horde
with the help of Highlord Tirion Fordring of the Knights of the Silver Hand, and have pledged to
do their part in defeating their former master, the Lich King. Their main base is Acherus: The
Ebon Hold, taken from the Scourge after breaking free.

### Creating a Death Knight
When creating your Death Knight, consider your relationship with the person or being that
resurrected you. Do you know who it was, or why they brought you back from death? Do you feel
indebted to them for giving you a second chance at life, or are you angry that they took you away
from your eternal rest?

Death knights often have terrible stories to tell that ended with their deaths. Consider your story
before your death—if you were once a paladin, consider the oath you took. Do you remember it? Do
you choose to follow those tenets again, or forsake your paladin teachings and follow a new path? If
you were a noble or important member of your society, how do you cope with their expectations
and your role? What evils have you committed under the Lich King‘s dominion? Have you
committed crimes that you secretly approve of, such as the murder of a noble who let you down in
your old life, or lethally ending rivalries in life? Have you been commanded to use your power to
raise the dead, and have you had a choice in raising anyone you once knew?

Also, consider if and how you will attempt to reintegrate with society; most citizens of Azeroth fear
and suspect the intentions of death knights, and might try to sabotage their acceptance. Have you
wronged anyone who might oppose your reentry into society? Will you accept being separate from
all factions, and choose to take up quests with only like-minded individuals?

#### Quick Build
You can make a death knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your
highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the noble or criminal background

### Class Features
As a death knight, you have the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per death knight level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Stamina modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Stamina modifier per death knight level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None

___
- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Spirit
- **Skills:** Choose four from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Deception, and Religion.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a martial weapon and a shield or *(b)* two martial weapons
- *(a)* five javelins or *(b)* any simple melee weapon
- *(a)* a priest‘s pack or *(b)* an explorer‘s pack
- Chain mail and an unholy symbol

#### Special

##### Corruption
Upon gaining a level in this class, you may permanently pledge your soul as well, turning yourself
into an undead creature (permanently gaining the below Undead Nature ability, and counting as
the undead creature type).

##### Undead Nature
You don‘t require air, food, drink, or sleep. You are also immune to nonmagical
poisons and diseases, and have advantage to effects that cause the exhausted and poisoned
conditions.

Also, an uncorrupted draenei who takes on the mantle of death knight may alter their Gift of the
Naaru ability, casting the Death Hex spell instead, as the draenei takes a unique shadow-fel shade of
their Eredar heritage in exchange of the holy powers of the Naaru. This extremely uncommon
sacrifice also takes its toll on the draenei‘s body, slowly morphing their appearance through
extended exposure to fel magic to be more like the Eredar, but turning their skin sickly pale blue
instead of red.

##### Rune Spells
Death Knights are the only class that can access the rune array spell, and can prepare different runes
for strike effects. Runes are magical enhancements that can enhance a death knight‘s weapon
attacks, and can be released in coordination with the Runic Strike ability to cause a devastating
strike.

##### Rune-Bound
Upon gaining a level in this class, you can turn one (of both, if using two weapons to fight) of your
weapons into Runeblades, a weapon infused with the might of the Lich King and his blessing.
Runeblades have three benefits:
* They serve as spellbooks and store spells (as described under Spellcasting).
* You gain advantage to saving throws against any effect that controls your character or alters
their alignment against the Lich King‘s will while using them.
* The blade serves as an unholy symbol.
* The runeblade is a greater attunement weapon (see Chapter 5: Equipment).
You cannot have multiple Runeblades (beyond the one you choose or two you fight with). If lost,
the blade usually finds its way back to you (or you to it) due to the bond you share.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a soothing darkness, gifting peaceful
oblivion of death and whispers of powerful forces, and powerful good brings painful brightness,
shattered memories, and the creeping return of life.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn,
you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind
total cover.

You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its
identity (the lich Kel‘Thuzad, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of
any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

#### Corrupting Touch
Your cursed touch can cause unholy wounds. As an action, you may perform a corrupting touch on
a target, investing them with damaging energies. For every mana point you spend for Corrupting
Touch, you heal a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus if targeting an undead or
fiend. Amount you heal is instead treated as shadow damage for living creatures (in which case, this
requires a melee spell attack). Excess hit points are lost, and you cannot heal or deal more damage
than a value equal to your maximum hit points. When performing Corrupting Touch on yourself,
this is instead a bonus action, and you are always healed by this ability, regardless of your creature
type.

Alternatively, you can expend the mana to inflict one disease or one poison of your choice. Each
disease or poison requires spending mana points equal to one-quarter the saving throw DC of the
poison or disease. You may inflict multiple diseases or poisons this way. You can choose be a carrier
to up to three separate poisons or diseases on your person. You need previous exposure to a poison
or disease to be a carrier.

This feature has no effect on constructs.

#### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast
spells as a paladin does.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A death knight can conjure and bind aberrations, fiends, and undead.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each death knight level provides you with 0.5 caster levels in the death knight class (minimum 0).

You follow the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You can change your list of prepared spells by consulting your runeblade‘s runes (treat as a
spellbook), which takes 1 minute per spell level to alter the readied spell.

You prepare the list of death knight spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the
death knight spell list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest by training and
studying your Runeblade (treat as a spellbook). Preparing a new list of death knight spells requires
time spent in prayer and re-attuning to the

\columnbreak

spell-runes: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell
on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your death knight spells, since their power derives from the
strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a death
knight spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier

##### Spellbook – Runeblade
At 2nd level, your runeblade contains three 1st-level death knight spells of your choice. When you
level up, you gain 2 additional death knight spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells
by research, tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your runeblade is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by scribing with runic inks.

You can choose to store your death knight spells in a spellbook instead or as runes on any other
surface as well.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an unholy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your death knight spells, or you can treat
your runeblade as your focus.

#### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.

You can‘t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Defense** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have
the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting**
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the
second attack.

#### Runic Strike
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend mana
equal to one death knight spell to deal shadow damage to the target, in addition to the weapon‘s
damage.

The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a
maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is a celestial or a follower of the Holy
Light (or if not a follower, one who merely uses it).

If you have a rune active, you may also perform a Runic Strike without expending mana (called Runic Release),

\pagebreakNum

terminating the effects of the rune (plus an additional effect depending on the
seal). Despite the name, Runic Strike does not count as a Strike effect.

#### Death Knight Aura
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery over aura spells begins to manifest. You always have the following
aura spells prepared.
* At 3rd level, you always have the abandonment aura spell prepared.
* At 6th level, you always have the necrotic aura spell prepared.
* At 10th level, you always have the unholy aura spell prepared.
* At 14th level, you always have the distraction aura spell prepared.
* At 18th level, you always have the vulnerability aura spell prepared.
Furthermore, you may cast each of the above aura spells for no cost once upon reaching the
described level. You regain all expended uses after a short rest. You may expend a free aura use to
cancel one successful turn undead attempt that affected your undead allies.

#### Dark Path
When you reach 3rd level, you walk a path that defines you as a death knight forever. Up to this
time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you
choose the Path of Blood for vengeance, Path of Frost for cold disregard for life, or Path of the
Unholy to defy the heavens, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features
include path spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

##### Path Spells
Each path has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the
path description. Once you gain access to a path spell, you always have it prepared. Path spells
don‘t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain a path spell that doesn‘t appear on the death knight spell list, the spell is nonetheless a
death knight spell for you.

##### Channel Divinity
Your path allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity
option provided by your path explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you
choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this
class, the DC equals your death knight spell save DC.

By default, you may always Turn Good, and gain an additional choice from your Path.

##### Channel Divinity: Turn Good
As an action, you present your unholy symbol and speak a prayer censuring humanoids, celestials,
and beasts, using your Channel Divinity. Each humanoid, celestial or beast that can see or hear you
within 30 feet of you must make a Spirit saving throw.

If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned
creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can‘t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can‘t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there‘s nowhere to
move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn.

#### Cursed Carrier
Starting at 6th level, you can carry diseases in your body, and spread them by touch (if contact),
scratch (if injury), breath (if inhaled), or spit (if ingested). You can carry up to three diseases of your
choice with this ability, above the normal three added by Corrupting Touch.

#### Improved Runic Strike
By 11th level, you are so suffused with the might of the Lich King that all your melee weapon
strikes carry his unholy power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the
creature takes an extra 1d8 shadow damage. If you also use your Runic Strike with an attack, you
add this damage to the extra damage of your Runic Strike.

#### Dispelling Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing
creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Aura Improvement
Also starting at 18th level, you can no longer lose concentration on an aura from taking damage,
and may extend the range of any aura spell by 100%. Any effect that would normally dispel the
aura instead suppresses it for 1 minute instead.

### Path of Blood
You are a dark guardian who manipulates and corrupts life energy to sustain themselves in the face
of the enemy‘s onslaught. Blood death knights invoke ancient legends of blood-drinking beings
who are immortal on the battlefield.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Path of Blood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Death coil, charm undead |

| 9th | Bind undead (3rd level), bestow curse |
| 13th | Confusion, rune array (worm) |
| 17th | Antilife shell, death and decay |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Blood Ward
You can spend a Channel Divinity use as a reaction to enhance
any aura you have to resist hostile magic. Choose one school of magic. You can grant yourself and
everyone within range of any aura you have advantage on saving throws versus any magical effect
from that school 1 minute.

#### Blood Strike [Strike]
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, whenever you hit a
living creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend one of your hit dice to regain health.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:510px;"></div>

#### Blood Tap
Starting at 7th level, whenever you use Death Pact to restore mana, the mana restored
is increased by 50% (or 3 mana points per spell level).

#### Will of the Necropolis
Starting at 15th level, whenever you are bloodied, you may cast the death
coil spell as a bonus action instead of an action. This feature can be used once per instance of you
suffering the condition, or twice per instance if you are under the effects of the avatar form death
knight spell.

#### Life Stealer
Starting at 20th level, whenever you are dropped to 0 hit points, you may use your
death pact spell on any dying creature as well as undead and fiends as a reaction.

You may also instead tear the life from living targets within 30 ft. as a reaction, stealing a number
of hit points equal to ¼ their current hit points, and restoring your hit points by the same amount.

The target may resist with Stamina saving throw against your Spell Save DC. This may be used once
per Charisma modifier (minimum 1) before requiring a long rest.

<div style="margin-top:480px;"></div>

### Path of Frost
You are a harbinger of doom, channeling runic power and delivering freezing weapon strikes. Frost
death knights are terrors of the frozen wastes.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Path of Frost Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Icy touch, rune array (frozen wastes) |
| 5th | Hold, consecration/desecration |
| 9th | Blizzard, curse of the elements |
| 13th | Blight, ice storm |
| 17th | Cone of cold (howling blast), cripple |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Freeze
You can spend a Channel Divinity use as an action to cause enemies
within a 20-foot radius to be wracked with unbearable pain as you freeze their blood. The targets
must succeed a Charisma save or suffer Disadvantage to all attack rolls and skill checks, and move
at half movement while in the affected area. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Death
Knight level. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn every round.

#### Frost Presence
Starting when you gain this archetype at 3rd level, whenever you deal cold damage
through a death knight spell or ability, you deal extra cold damage equal to your proficiency bonus,

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:490px;"></div>

applying once per round. You also gain resistance to cold damage.

#### Might of the Wastes [Strike]
Starting at 7th level, your frost-sharpened weapons deals a critical hit
on a roll of 19 or 20 as a strike effect. You also deal an additional 1d4 points of cold damage
whenever you strike an enemy with this. You may also add the extra damage from your Frost
Presence ability to this. Despite being a strike effect, you can make an off-hand attack with a Bonus
Action and still maintain this strike effect.

#### Frozen Soul
Starting at 15th level, whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points from a cold
spell, or if they under the effects of your Freeze channel divinity, your next Runic Strike within 1
hour has no mana cost. You may also choose to deal half of your Runic Strike‘s extra damage as
cold damage. If you choose to do so, you may add half the bonus to damage from your Frost
Presence ability. If you are under the effects of the avatar form death knight spell, your next two
Runic Strikes within 1 hour have no mana cost.

#### Pillar of Frost
Starting at 20th level, supernatural ice hangs heavy on your body. This increases
your strength score by 4 to a max of 24 and your Stamina by 2 to a max of 22.

Unholy death knights lead armies of the dead and overwhelm their enemies.

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Bolster Undead
You can use a Channel Divinity use to guard undead against
being turned, as well as empowering them. All and any undead under your command within 30 ft.
of you may add your Proficiency bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for one
minute, and may ignore one Turn Undead attempt. This does not stack with their own proficiency
bonuses.

You cannot benefit from the numeric bonus, even if you are undead, but can resist one Turn

Undead attempt as normal. This bonus remains for ten minutes.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:500px;"></div>

#### Undead Companion
At 3rd level, you gain a bound companion that accompanies you on your
adventures and can fight alongside you. The companion must be an undead that is no larger than
Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower (for example, a lesser ghoul). See Bound
Companion for more details.

#### Bond
Due to your bond with the creature, you can add your proficiency bonus to the undead‘s AC,
attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. This does
not stack with their own proficiency bonuses.

Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your death knight level,
whichever is higher. The creature benefits from Bolster Undead the same way you do.

#### Leveling up
Your undead companion improves in CR the higher your level becomes, CR equal to 1 per every 8
levels of Death Knight (improving to 1 CR at level 4, 2 CR at level 8, and 3 CR at level 16). This
either takes the form of choosing a higher-level companion, or adding hit dice to the companion
until its CR increases.

When reaching 8th level, you can choose a Large creature. The companion also gains an Ability
Score Improvement once you do (this acts as the normal feature).

#### Special
Bonding with an undead requires spending one hour animating it, and the next hour drawing from
any superficial memories before its death. You can apply the skeletal or zombie monster template to
any creature that qualifies and

can be subject to animation by casting the bind spell on them.


You may also raise your enemies to serve as undead companions, so long as their CR are within the
described guidelines (treat 1 level as 1 CR).

#### Grave March
At 7th level, your auras increase in strength. You may maintain two aura spells at
once as if they were one spell. Furthermore, your allies can also benefit from two auras at a time, so
long as one of these spells is the Unholy Aura spell. The maximum duration of your unholy aura
spell is 4 hours instead of 1.

Also, whenever in a forced march, all creatures under your unholy aura spell have advantage to
saving throws to continue a march without suffering exhaustion, and can move at a fast pace
without incurring a penalty to their Passive Spirit (Perception) score.

#### Army of the Dead
Starting at 15th level, your conjure undead (animate undead) spells are inherently
stronger than others. You may cast the conjure undead spell as an action instead of 1 minute when
conjuring undead. Once this feature is used, it cannot be used again until after a short rest.

If you cast the spell with its full casting time, a number of zombies arise to fight for you and protect
you while you focus on casting the spell. The number of zombies is equal to 2 per spell level, so far
as there are sufficient corpses within 30 feet.

These temporary undead followers are friendly to you and your allies, and are controlled as normal
summons, but do not count against your limit of summoned undead. The DM has the zombies‘
statistics. Once the spell‘s casting time ends and you successfully cast the conjure undead spell, you
can use an action to maintain the additional zombies. The additional zombies cannot remain more
than 10 minutes. If you lose concentration on the spell, you also lose concentration on the
zombies, and they stop animating.

Furthermore, if you do not have the required number of corpses (the required material focus) for
animating undead, you use corpses from any place so long as you are within 1 mile of a graveyard,
mass grave, battlefield, or any location with sufficient number of corpses so long as they are not on
hallowed ground. The earth must be loose enough for the zombies to dig their way out. The
temporary undead you create from casting conjure undead require the corpses to be within 30 feet,
however.

#### Unholy Champion
Starting at 20th level, you gain the avatar form death knight spell for no cost if
you didn‘t already have it. Furthermore, you augment the spell in the following ways:
* You are instantly healed for 3d8 + 10 hit points. The healing increases by 1d8 per spell
level above 3rd.
* You become resistant to damage from good aligned targets (or magical weapons) as well as
to shadow damage.
* Any undead within any active aura you have regains 2d6 hit points every round. This
cannot exceed half their total hit points.

## Druid (DRD)
*The night elf notices a broken blade of familiar design, and
then a disturbance in the distance. She rises, and runs toward
the sound, leaping through the forest expertly and silently. As
she comes to a waterfall, she leaps off the edge of the cliff, a
wave of purple mist enveloping her, as she shapeshifts into a
saber cat, prepared for further pursuit.*
<br><br>
*An ancient troll stands quietly atop an equally old ziggurat, eyes
narrowing against the bright red sunrise. In the distance, the
waves bring the promise of war as ships sail towards his
homeland. He speaks a prayer to the Loa, before shapeshifting
into a leathery-winged primordial pterrordax, and rising upon the winds to scout the danger
approaching his home.*
<br><br>
*A worgen stalks the forest, hunting her quarry, smelling blood. She emerges to a worgen stirred
into a blood-frenzy upon a wounded human, prepared to bite it. She shouts, causing the mindless
beast to turn to her. She raises her hand, bringing a pillar of moonlight down, searing the worgen‘s
fur. As the blinding light subsides, an unconscious human lies on the grass, curse overwhelmed by
the moon-goddess‘s holy strength.*
<br><br>
Druids are keepers of the world who walk the path of nature, following the wisdom of the Ancients
and Cenarius, healing and nurturing the world. To druids, nature is a delicate balance of actions in
which even the smallest imbalance can create storming turmoil from peaceful skies. Druids draw
their power from this natural energy, using it to change their shapes and command the forces of
nature. Traditionally, druids chose the path of a specific animal totem. Since the invasion of the
Burning Legion, however, most druids have undergone a number of reforms, including
encouraging the study of magic from all totems. Druids who do this are known as druids of the
wild.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:460px;"></div>

### Balance and Harmony
Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience,
druids can unleash nature‘s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a
great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones.

Druids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies. They are deeply in
tune with the animal spirits of Azeroth. As master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a
variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, storm crow, or sea lion with ease. This flexibility allows
them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and
surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. These keepers of the natural order are among the
most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a
moment‘s notice.

Cenarius is the patron entity of all druids. However, each group of druids has its own special
patrons and some even have the ability to transform into a being that looks like their patron. Many
druids take on an animal companion based on their patron.

### Call of the Wild
A druid's empathy with the creatures of the wild also allows him to shapeshift into the forms of
other animals. For example, a wounded druid whose magical energies are running low might
abruptly take on the form of a bear in order to better withstand further injury. Alternatively, the
druid might shift into the form of some large cat, sneak up behind an enemy, then pounce and
deliver a fierce flurry of melee attacks. Even the deepest oceans can be explored by a druid, who can
simply shift into an aquatic creature, allowing him to stay underwater as long as needed.

\pagebreakNum

Druids come and go as they please, and their goals typically have little to do with the ‗civilized‘
world. Unaffiliated with any specific government, the primary druidic organization on Azeroth, the
Cenarion Circle, answers to no one but itself.

The highest rank that a druid can have is that of archdruid, and there are only a few archdruids on
Azeroth. At the moment the Cenarion Circle's leader is Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, also
widely considered to be the first (and greatest) mortal druid on Azeroth.

### Creating a Druid
When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps
your character lives in a society where druidism still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being
abandoned in the depths of a forest, or burdened by a terrible curse to which druidism was a cure.

Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face
with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during
an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was
part of your character's destiny.

Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a
caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up
an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience,
druids can unleash nature‘s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a
great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones.

The druids of Azeroth nearly all belong to the circle of Cenarius. Druids otherwise corrupted still
belong to the same circle. Azerothian druids are more limited in the shapes they may choose when
transforming, but they gain an additional ability to empower said form.

#### Quick Build
You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Spirit should be your highest
ability score, followed by Stamina. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the gust,
thorn whip, and wrath cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your idol: primal roar
(abandonment aura), charm (beast), conjure (beast), entangling roots, faerie fire, and rejuvenation.

\pagebreakNum

#### Druidic
You know druidic, the secret language of druids, fey, and spirits of the wild. You can speak the
language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language
automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message‘s presence with a successful DC 15
Spirit (Perception) check but can‘t decipher it without magic. If you can speak druidic, you can
communicate one-way with all other druids and fey creatures, even if you don‘t otherwise share a
language. Natural beasts understand simple commands in druidic.

#### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A druid can conjure and bind aberrations, beasts, elementals, fey, oozes, and plants.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each druid level provides you with 1 caster level in the druid class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell
list. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest by meditating in
nature and consulting your druidic idol (treat as a spellbook). Preparing a new list of druid spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

##### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your
idol. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Spirit is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion
and attunement to nature. You use your Spirit whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Spirit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier

##### Spellbook – Idol
At 1st level, your idol contains six 1st-level druid spells of your choice. When you level up, you gain
2 additional druid spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research, tutelage, or
from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your idol is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by meditating with it and inhaling
herbal vapors.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic idol as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

#### Druid Circle
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Balance to preserve the
order of nature, the Circle of the Feral Beast to act within nature‘s order, or the Circle of
Restoration to keep and preserve living things, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your
choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you may choose a land-bound beast to morph into as an action. You can use
this feature twice before requiring a short or long rest. The creature selected can be any beast that
cannot fly or swim naturally, such as a wolf, lion, bear, tiger, etc. You remain in this form a number
of hours equal to half your druid level (round down).

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert
to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you
fall unconscious (unless if sleeping by your own volition, such as by resting or the slumber spell),
drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your
alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Spirit, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your
skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.
* If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than
yours, use the creature‘s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions,
you can't use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast‘s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to
your normal form, you retain the percentage of hit points your wild shape form ended with, but
this cannot reduce your hit points by more than one-quarter your hit point total (for instance, wild
shaping to a creature at full hit points and ending the spell at 0 hit points reduces your current hit
points by one-quarter). If the spell ended from your hit points being reduced to 0 or below, you
revert back automatically, and reduce your current hit points by one-quarter as described.
* You can‘t cast spells unless those noted by other abilities, and your ability to speak or take
any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming
doesn‘t break your concentration on a spell you‘ve already cast, however, or prevent you from
taking actions that are part of a spell (such as call lightning) that you‘ve already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use
them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can‘t use any of your special
senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your
new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is
practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature‘s shape and size.
Your equipment doesn‘t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the
new form can‘t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with
the form has no effect until you leave the form.

\pagebreakNum

Starting at 4th level, you may choose a creature with natural swimming capabilities and underwater
breathing, such as a sea lion, a seal, a fish, a shark, etc.
At 8th level, you may choose a creature with natural flying capabilities (such as giant eagles,
dragonhawks, storm-crows, or vultures) to the list of creatures you can transform to.
At 12th level, you may take the form of a tree or plant creature, and add minor ancients to the list
of creatures you can transform to.
The chosen creature forms are equal to your Spirit modifier from each category (land, water, air,
and plant), and the suite cannot be changed later except when leveling up (in which case you may
choose a new suite of creatures for each category). Creatures you may transform to have a
maximum CR of your hit dice divided by 8 (¼ at level 2, ½ at level 4, 1 at level 8, and 2 at level
16).

#### Ancient Power
Starting at 2nd level, you may rapidly recover your mana by invoking ancient powers. You can use
your action and bonus action on your turn to regain mana as if completed a short rest (or rested for
one hour).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. You regain
expended uses when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, natural energies suffuse you,
imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting you advantage to saving
throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

Alternatively, if you use this during a short rest or when you are below one-quarter your maximum
mana point pool, you are treated as if you rested for two hours instead of one. This is atop the
mana you regain for the normal rest.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Timeless
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10
actual years you live, your body ages one year only.

#### Beast Spells
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild
Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape,
but you aren‘t able to provide material components.

#### Archdruid
At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can
ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components
that lack a cost and aren‘t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape
and your various Wild Shapes.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/Mgi0q18.png' style='position:absolute; top:10px; right:0px; width:890px;' />

<div style="margin-top:290px;"></div>

### Balance
You achieve a balance between the powers and influence of the moon and sun. Balance druids
usually stand in the back lines, invigorating their allies and calling down shooting stars on their
foes.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Balance Circle Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Barkskin, entangling roots |
| 5th | Call lightning, plant growth |
| 7th | Divination, freedom of movement |
| 9th | Commune with nature, tree stride |

</div>

#### Eclipse Pool
Starting at 2nd level, whenever you successfully deal arcane or holy damage to an
enemy through a Druidic spell or ability, you gain one Eclipse point. You cannot gain more than
one per round. This also applies once per spell, not once per target or sigil pulse. Eclipse points are
used to empower your abilities.

For every Eclipse point you have, you may deal an additional 1 point of arcane or holy damage per
dice of the spell, if the spells or abilities deals arcane or holy damage. You may have a maximum
number of eclipse points equal to 2 plus your Proficiency bonus, and they remain for one hour
after being acquired.

#### Balance of Sun and Moon
Also starting at 2nd level, you may expend one Eclipse point when
casting a spell that deals arcane or holy damage to apply one of the following effects:
* Deal 2d6 extra points of damage of that type atop the normal bonus
* Cast the wrath cantrip as a bonus action. On a successful hit with the cantrip, you regain
the Eclipse point.

#### Moonkin
Starting at 6th level, you may always transform into a wildkin when wild shaping.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:340px;"></div>

Furthermore, when transformed to a wildkin, you may still cast druidic spells of the Transmutation
and Evocation schools. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells of the
Transmutation and Evocation schools while in a beast shape, but you aren‘t able to provide
material components. Furthermore, you gain three Eclipse points when you enter this form.

When in this form or while under the effects of the avatar form spell, such spells cost 1 mana less
than normal. Once you gain the Beast Spells druid feature of 18th level, you can cast spells as
normal, but you still benefit from the mana cost reduction for those specific spell schools.

Shooting Star. Starting at 10th level, you may reroll the damage roll for any druid spell you cast by
expending an Eclipse Point. If the dice‘s roll is the maximum possible result (6 on d6, 4 on d4,
etc.), you may roll again and add that damage to the total.

Also, while under the effects of the avatar form spell, whenever you spend an Eclipse point, roll a
1d4. On a roll of a 4, it is not spent.

#### World in Balance
Starting at 14th level, you can command the world to hear your call, and call a
solar or lunar eclipse (depending on the time). Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again
until after a long rest.

#### Solar Eclipse (Day only)
The sun‘s light is covered by a shadow which blankets the earth in a 5-mile
radius centered on the druid for one hour. The area becomes dim light or normal light (your
choice), and creatures sensitive to sunlight do not take penalties from sunlight. All your druid spells
that deal arcane damage do so as if your Eclipse pool was full. You also gain one Eclipse Point per
minute.

#### Lunar Eclipse (Night only)
The moon‘s light is bright and cloaked in the shadow which blankets the
earth in a 5-mile radius centered on the druid for one hour. The area becomes either dim or
normal light (your choice), and creatures sensitive to moonlight or sunlight take penalties
(depending on your wish) when in the area. All your druid spells that deal holy damage do so as if
your Eclipse pool is full. You also gain one Eclipse Point per minute.

<div style="margin-top:250px;"></div>

### Feral
Your magical talents bring you closer to beasts of the wild, making you prime and paragon above
them. Feral druids often take up traits of the beasts they shape to.

#### Fortitude of the Wilds
When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use
Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action or a reaction, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one
spell to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell expended.

#### Fury of the Wilds
Also when gaining this archetype, when determining your maximum allowable
CR to transform to, you divide your level by three, and not eight (round down), referring to the
below table.

| Druid Level | Maximum CR |
|:---:|:---:|
| 2 | 1/2
| 4 | 1
| 6 | 2
| 9 | 3
| 12 | 4
| 15 | 5
| 18 | 6

#### Primal Strike
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of
overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. You also gain a +1 bonus
to your attack and damage rolls.

#### Blessed Beast
Starting at 10th level, you may gain a special ability when in wild shape. Choose any
of category of wild shape (land, sea, air, or plant), and you may assign one of the following abilities
to all creatures in that category when wild shaping into them, but only when in that form. Upon
reaching 15th level, you may choose another option.
* Defending beast: Whenever you start your turn while in wild shape, you gain 5 temporary hit points. Furthermore,
you can, as a reaction, gain resistance to one damage type of your choice. This
remains for one minute, and cannot be used again until you complete a short rest.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:320px;"></div>

* Furious beast: You gain the Berserker Rage talent.
* Holy beast: You gain the priest‘s Channel Divinity as a holy priest, but only to Turn Undead.
Your effective priest level for this ability is equal to half your druid level. Fiends are also
turned by this ability, but cannot be destroyed as undead. You cannot increase the number of uses
of the Channel Divinity effect (regardless of effective priest level).
* Inspiring beast: You gain the bard‘s Inspiration ability. Your effective bard level for this
ability is equal to half your druid level.
* Magical beast: You may choose any four spells from your druid spell list and cast them in
while in wild shape. This does not require somatic or verbal components, but you must have
chosen to merge any material components with you when you chose to wild shape. If taken again,
this ability adds four other spells. 
Upon gaining the Beast Spells feature of 18th level, you may cast all your druid spells without
somatic or verbal components, as this ability details. You may choose up four spells per use of this
ability, and use their material components while wild shaped.
* Prowling beast: Whenever you and an ally both threaten a creature, your ally gains advantage
to attack rolls against it, and you deal 1d6 extra points of damage to it.
* Persistent beast: Whenever you are in a wild shape, you have advantage to Stamina saving
throws to maintain a concentration spell. Furthermore, if you lose concentration on a spell by
taking damage while in wild shape, you regain half the mana spent on the spell. This does not
count as a normal mana restorative effect.
* Raking beast: You gain the rogue‘s Sneak Attack ability as a 1st level rogue. If chosen again,
your effective rogue level for this ability is equal to half your druid level.
Grand Beast. Starting at 14th level, your weapon attacks while in wild shape deal an additional die
of damage, and your bonus to attack and damage rolls from your Primal Strike feature improves to
+2.

Also, if you start your turn while under a wild shape, you gain 5 temporary hit points. These do not
stack.

#### Grand Beast
Starting at 14th level, your weapon attacks while in wild shape deal an additional die
of damage, and your bonus to attack and damage rolls from your Primal Strike feature improves to
+2.

Also, if you start your turn while under a wild shape, you gain 5 temporary hit points. These do not
stack.

<div style="margin-top:420px;"></div>

### Restoration
You focus on the renewing and resilient quality of nature. Restoration druids appreciate the more
organic side of nature, preferring to conjure plant allies (usually treants), heal their friends, and
reach out through the Emerald Dream for information and insights to the future.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Restoration Circle Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Pass without trace, rejuvenation |
| 5th | Daylight, lesser restoration |
| 7th | Divination, conjure plants (level 3) |
| 9th | Dream, tranquility |

</div>

#### Healing Lore
When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you may alter the target of a druid sigil
spell effect as a bonus action. This requires a successful attack against the new target, and you must
be within the range of them to cast the spell normally. The spell‘s effects take place at the new
target‘s turn as usual.

#### Extended Growth
Also starting at 2nd level, the maximum duration of healing sigil druid spells
for you is doubled, and you gain advantage to the roll to maintain druid sigil spells.
Seed of Life. Starting at 6th level, you may touch any creature as an action, and store any spell from
the druid spell list into them, which remains latent until you discharge it with a mental command.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:430px;"></div>

If the spell‘s casting time is more than 1 action, you must also spend the casting time in contact
with the target, as well as any required components. So long as the seed remains active, you gain a
general and vague sense of the well-being of the creature and their physical and mental health, and
you may use a reaction at any point to discharge the spell (in reaction to sudden pain or mental
distress), although the spell does not specify the particulars of the triggering event.

If you choose the Lesser Restoration or Greater Restoration spells (or similar effects), the spell can
also notify you when the target is affected by a condition the spell would heal or remove (such as
death if imbuing revivify).

The seed remains active for up 24 hours, after which it fades. You may also discharge this spell only
if the target is within 5 miles of you. If you and the target are within similar terrain and there are
live plants within 30 feet of both of you (such as being in the same forest or desert), you can
discharge the spell at any range so long as the natural terrain is unbroken. You can place up to
three seeds per day, and a creature can only benefit from one at any given time.

This feature has no effect on constructs unless they are plant-based or made of wood.

#### Ironbark
Starting at 10th level, whenever you heal a creature (including yourself), you may imbue
their skin with the resilience of nature. If you do, they gain resistance to all non-magical weapon
damage for 1 minute, or gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level. A given
creature can benefit only once every 24 hours.

#### Improved Seed of Life
Starting at 14th level, you may imbue up to six seeds of life at once, and
can imbue a single target with up to two seeds. You can also use an action to see up to a distance of
5 ft. from a creature affected by your Seed of Life, so long as the ability wasn‘t discharged yet. You
have no use of your normal senses while you are perceiving this way.

## Hunter (HTR)

*A dwarf watches over frozen mountains, a loyal bear next to him
breathing out warm buffs of breath against the falling snow. The
dwarf studies the tracks in the snow, and then lifts his firearm,
beckoning the bear to continue forward.*
<br><br>
*Stalking her prey, a troll loads a bolt into her crossbow. The
panther is completely unaware of her, as she prowls through the
jungle. Until it is too late. Before she can react, the bolt pierces
her skull, as the troll walks calmly to claim her prize.*
<br><br>
*As a ship enters the harbor, a thin whistle of a crossbow bolt whispers in the wind. The navigator
silently collapses, dragging the ship‘s wheel with her as she falls, forcing the ship to veer off and
collide with the dock‘s wooden beams, before its hull is punctured by the harbor‘s rocky bottom,
sinking. A goblin disappears back into the forest from his perch, his job complete, sporting a quiet
smile on his face.*
<br><br>
From an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into
the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. Masters of their
environment, they are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their
enemies.

### Deadly Rangers
Warriors of the wilderness, hunters specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of
civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and even
dragons. They learn to track their prey as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and

Hunters focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific
favored foes. Thanks to their intimate familiarity with the wilds, hunters also acquire the ability to
cast spells that harness nature‘s power, much like a druid. Their spells, like their combat abilities,
focus on speed, stealth, and the hunt.

### Independant Adventurers
Hunters are stalkers in the wild, living on their knowledge of survival and skill with a bow or rifle.
They are deeply in tune with nature and some of its mightiest beasts are their allies. Of Azeroth's
many creatures, few can resist the hunters' call, and fewer can survive their fury. Hunters are as
varied as the world's many climates, but they are universally renowned for their amazing abilities to
find their prey and bring it down. They come from any race, though certain races naturally excel at
the hunter's profession. Most hunters seek to aid the balance of nature along with their druidic
allies.

Hunters are skilled in stealth, slipping through the woods like a ghost. Orcs of the Horde first
learned the ways of the Azerothian hunter from forest trolls on Lordaeron and tauren have been
masters of the hunt since the dawn of the world. Like the druid, hunters call upon the spirits of the
land, wind, and fire to aid them in their hunts and tasks. 

### Creating a Hunter
As you create your hunter character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your
particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you
mastered the hunter‘s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain— perhaps
by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills
as part of a band of hunter‘s

\pagebreakNum

affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as
wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a
magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

What‘s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone
you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters
cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a
continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you
join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the
wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

#### Quick Build
You can make a hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Agility your highest
ability score, followed by Spirit. (Some hunters who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength
higher than Agility.) Second, choose the outlander background.

\pagebreakNum

#### Favored Enemy
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking
to a certain type of enemy. Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials,
constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.
Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on contested skill checks against your favored enemies, as well as on
Intelligence checks to recall information about them, and when making an attack against them, you
deal 2 extra points of damage.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your
favored enemies, if they speak one at all. As you gain levels, your choices reflect the types of
monsters you have encountered on your adventures. You choose one additional favored enemy, as
well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level.

You may switch this feature (and your chosen favored enemy) by performing the following tasks
against one creature type (or two races of humanoids):
* Defeat it in single combat
* Track and survey the creature type for at a total of 24 hours over 7 days
* Examine its corpse for at one hour
You cannot change a favored enemy this way if it is limited to an organization, but can do the same
to other organizations. You may switch back to previously studied favored enemy at the end of a
long rest. The language gained by the initial favored enemy choices cannot be re-chosen by
switching favored enemies.

#### Hunter Talent
Starting at 1st level, you gain a class talent, representing your preferred tactics and abilities you
honed through your experience of hunting. See Class Talents at the end of the Chapter 3 for
options.

Whenever you qualify for another talent (as detailed in the talent column), you can choose another
talent or gain another use of an existing talent.

#### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following
options. You can‘t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose
again.
* **Archery** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
* **Defense** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Hunter Focus
You may choose to gain the ability to cast spells (drawing from the divine essence of nature itself) or to gain proficiency in engineering. Choose either the Spellcasting or Engineering features.

#### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A hunter can conjure and bind beasts, elementals, fey, and plants. Beast master hunters often
choose their animal companions from previously bounded animals.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each hunter level provides you with 0.5 caster levels in the hunter class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of hunter spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the hunter
spell list.

When you do so, you may ready a number of hunter spells equal to half the number you can
prepare normally (a 3rd level hunter with +2 Spirit can prepare 2 spells instead of 5).

When you level up, you can exchange the spells known with others you qualify for. You cannot
otherwise change your hunter spells other than by leveling up and exchanging them, or by training
under another hunter, druid, or fey creature (see tutorship under magic), who can change your
prepared spells after training is completed.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Spirit is your spellcasting ability for your hunter spells, since your magic draws upon your
attunement to nature. You use your Spirit whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Spirit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier

##### Spellbook – Idol
At 2nd level, your idol contains three 1st-level hunter spells of your choice. When you level up, you
gain 2 additional hunter spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research,
tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your idol is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by meditating with it and inhaling
herbal vapors.

##### Shot Spells
Shot spells may be cast while attacking with a ranged weapon, and counts as a strike feat for most
purposes except where otherwise noted.

Some hunters eschew the arts of nature magic, and instead focus entirely on technology.
They can lose access to all spells, and instead gain the Sharpshooter feature instead of the
Spellcasting Feature.

#### Sharpshooter
You gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools and weapons created by the tools (such as firearms and
explosives). You also create and maintain such weapons with a 25% reduction to cost.

If you already have proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools, you instead gain expertise to all checks with
these tools (although this does not improve the strength of technologically-crafted items).
You also gain one of the following features of your choice:
* The Suffused Arrows talent.
* The Flash Bomber talent

\pagebreakNum

#### Hunter Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Beast Master who bonds with
an animal, a Marksman who always finds their target and excels in bringing them down, and a
Survivalist, who has several terrain-based abilities and is an expert ambusher, all of which are
detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at
7th, 11th, and 15th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn.

#### Hide in Plain Sight
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have
access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create
your camouflage. Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up
against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a
+10 bonus to Agility (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions.

Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again with an action
so long as she remains in the same general terrain type. If you are in a different terrain, you must
spend another minute.

#### Foe Slayer
Starting at 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your
turns, you can add your Spirit modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll. You can choose to use
this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

<div style="margin-top:380px;"></div>

### Beast Master
Your bond with the land is stronger than that of other hunters, a bonded beast appropriate to your
terrain has chosen to fight alongside you. Beast master hunters are the most common adventuring
hunters to fight without aid.

#### Hunter’s Companion
At 3rd level, you gain a bound companion that accompanies you on your
adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. This acts as a normal bound companion. The
companion must be a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or
lower (for example, a hawk, mastiff, or panther). See Bound Companion for more details. The
hunter is able to cast the bind spell to bind beasts, even if the spell is not prepared or spellcasting
was removed due to the Sharpshooter ability.

##### Bond
Due to your bond with the beast, you can add your proficiency bonus to the beast‘s AC, attack
rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. The beast also
gains proficiency in two skills of your choice, and to all saving throws. Due to your bond, however,
the companion loses the Multiattack feature (if it possesses it). This does not stack with their own
proficiency bonuses.

Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your hunter level, whichever is
higher.

Whenever you gain Extra Attack, you can give the extra attack action to your beast instead of using
it yourself. This decision is made on the start of your turn on every round. 

##### Leveling up
Your beast companion improves in CR the higher your level becomes, CR equal to 1 per every 8
levels of Hunter (improving to 1 CR at level 4, 2 CR at level 8, and 3 CR at level 16). This either
takes the form of choosing a higher-level companion, or adding hit dice to the companion until its
CR increases.

When reaching 8th level, you can choose a Large creature. The companion also gains an Ability
Score Improvement once you do (this acts as the normal feature).

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:380px;"></div>

##### Special
While traveling through your favored terrain with your beast, you can move stealthily at a normal
pace. Bonding with a beast requires spending one hour communicating with the creature by
nonverbal cues, and spending the next seven hours in bonding activities (hunting, etc.).

#### Spirit Bond. 
Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns, you can use a bonus action to command
the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on your turn. The beast also has
advantage with any saving throw to resist spells that control or repel it (such as charm or fear
spells), if the spell would cause it to abandon or betray you.

You may also empower the spirit link to your beast. Doing so takes 1 minute of physical contact
with a magic weapon (such as placing a magic sword against its paw, tapping it with a magic staff, or
resting a magic bow on it). Once the task is completed, the beast‘s weapon attacks are treated as
magical as well for 1 hour. You may use weapons that belong to others, but not if they are attuned
to others. If the weapon is attuned to you, it takes only 1 round of physical contact. 

#### Frenzy
Starting at 11th level, you can command your companion to attack with a bonus action,
allowing it to make two attacks when it uses an action to attack on its turn. This stacks with giving
your animal companion an extra attack from your Extra Attack feature.

Your animal companion‘s weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 and 20.

#### Empowered Bond
Beginning at 15th level, you and your animal companion may share the
damage both of you take by dividing it by two so long as you are within 30 feet of one another, as if
under the effects of the spirit link spell.

As long as you and your animal companion are within one mile or less of one another, you may
also use an action to see through your companion‘s eyes and sense through their normal senses,
though you are blind to your own surroundings if you do so.

\columnbreak

### Marksman
You are a master archer or sharpshooter who excels in bringing down enemies from afar.
Marksmen hunters are often favored allies in battle, as chosen shot spells and the ability to focus
their fire on an enemy can turn the tide of battle.

#### Careful Aim
Once you gain this archetype at 3rd level, you may use a bonus action as part of
shooting to grant yourself advantage your ranged weapon attack. You cannot use this if you already
moved in the previous round.

If you use a [Shot] effect or reload a firearm you are using, you can also benefit from advantage to
your ranged weapon attack.

#### Hawk Eye
Starting at 7th level, you double your range with all ranged weapon attacks. Also, your
first ranged attack in a given round is a critical hit if the target is surprised.

#### Multi-Shot Strike
Starting at 11th level, whenever you successfully strike an enemy with a ranged
attack, you may use a bonus action to attack any other target within 5 feet of the original target.

You may also instead designate a 10-foot-square within the range of your ranged weapon, and
bombard any number of enemies the area, dealing your normal weapon damage, plus the
minimum possible damage roll from each extra attack you have (taking the lowest result on the
weapon damage roll).

#### Chimera Shot [Shot]
Beginning at 15th level, you gain the ability to use Chimera Shot once per
Spirit modifier, regained at the end of a long rest. You may declare the use of Chimera Shot, which
allows you to combine the effects of up to three different shot spells in the same attack. This does
not cost mana.

If you do not have access to shot spells, you can use the properties of up to three different
ammunition types (such as suffused arrows or other special ammunition).

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/j0RJ7pI.png' style='position:absolute; bottom:0px; left:-50px; width:100%; height:100%;' />

### Survival
You are a rugged tracker who uses animal venom, explosives, and traps as deadly weapons. Survival
hunters usually walk alone, but make excellent advanced scouts and explorers who can handle
nearly any terrain.

#### Survival Knowledge
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Engineer‘s Tools (though only to
make traps and explosives) and the Poisoner‘s Kit.

You also gain +10 feet to your speed when wearing medium armor or less, and when not using a
shield.

#### Trap Expert
Starting at 7th level, any creature subjected to traps set by you have disadvantage to
their saves, or the trap has advantage to any attack against them, and you may add your Proficiency
bonus to all saving throw DCs or attack rolls made by traps you set or poisons you create.

The trap needs only to be set by you, and not necessarily built by you. You may also add one
additional explosive to any trap you set without triggering it (such as adding two mines, or one
mine and a wagon clamp).

#### Poison Science
Starting at 11th level, you can harvest triple the normal quantity of poisons from
dead creatures. You also gain resistance to all poison damage. Gaining acquired immunity to
poisons or diseases requires only one-quarter the normal time.

#### Grit
Starting at 15th level, you only lose a death saving throw on a dice result of a natural 1
(counts as one failure) or when being attacked while dying.

You may also apply poisons on your weapon as a bonus action.

Furthermore, you always count yourself as within your favored terrain for the purposes of travel (so
long as you have the favored terrain talent), and whenever one of your traps harm a creature, you
always treat it as if it is surprised against you, unless combat hasn‘t already started.

## Mage (MGE)
*Standing atop a ruined cliff-side chapel, a human
mage retreats against the demonic infernal. Climbing
up the side, the infernal barely has time to react, as
the human raises his arms, unleashing a volley of
fireballs at the infernal, before releasing a storm of ice
upon the demon, sending it spiraling into the chasm
below.*
<br><br>
*Surveying the battlefield from afar, a blood elf looks
to the skies, finishing the last words of the spell. The
clouds part as an ice crystals form, before falling to the
ground, crashing and wreaking bloody havoc amongst
her adversaries. Allowing the faintest smile, she walks
away from the carnage, her duty fulfilled.*
<br><br>
*The draenei mage-lord clad in violet and gold robes stands firm before fel winds. As a doomguard
elite breaks his flank, he turns to it, sweeping his hand at its direction, suffusing the fiend with
planar magic. The wills of the two clash, and then the doomguard roars in frustration, as he is
banished from the battlefield to whence he came. Satisfied, the draenei sweeps his staff over the
remaining demons. As the violet crystal sweeps over them, time slows, and they are torn apart by
swords loyal to the Army of Light.*
<br><br>
Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the Mage. The
arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most
devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, magi wear only cloth armor, but
arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, magi
can summon bursts of fire or storms of ice to decimate distant

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:520px;"></div>

targets and cause entire regiments to
erupt with elemental energy, or to barrage them with violet blasts of pure arcane magic.

### Scholars of the Arcane
The wizards of Azeroth are commonly known as mages, or magi. The magi of Azeroth acknowledge
the corrupting influence of arcane magic, and unlike Warlocks, they temper their advancement
with cool intellect and precision.

Mages focus on magic that creates and changes things, most often with the purpose of damaging
their enemies and boosting the power of their allies. Such beings can obtain a familiar, which is a
normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a
mage.

Magi also understand the workings of arcane energy so well they can counter most magic with great
effectiveness. Those who have dedication to and natural predilection for one of the schools of
specialization or a magic tradition becomes more entrenched.

The magi of the Kirin Tor first mastered the art of casting spells using the elements of ice and fire.

Magi are also known for being able to summon elementals, usually water elementals, but can also
summon air, earth, and fire elementals. The greatest mortal mage ever to have lived might be the
naga Queen Azshara (who may no longer be mortal) or the legendary human Medivh, the last
Guardian of Tirisfal, who set in motion many events in the Third War.

\pagebreakNum

The first known magi on Azeroth were elves. They existed before the breaking of the Well of
Eternity and the Exile of the High Elves, who lived on the shores of the Well of Eternity and
wielded its tremendous magic powers. When the elven kingdom made their ancient pact to aid the
human kingdom of Arathi, the magi learned arcane magic as well, turning the tide of the Troll
Wars to cement the human and elven presence in Azeroth.

### The Lure of Knowledge
Mages‘ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a mage is likely to come to an ordinary life is working
as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other
mages sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous mages out of the safety of
their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Mages believe that their
counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and
discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the
present age.

### Creating a Mage
Creating a Mage character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event.

How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an
aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly?
Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you
hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by
any other mage? Perhaps you‘re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the
face of danger.

#### Quick Build
You can make a mage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your
highest ability score, followed by Stamina or Agility.

Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the mage hand, light, and frost bolt cantrips,
along with the following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning hands, charm (humanoid), feather
fall, mana shield, arcane missile, and sleep.

#### Invocation
Starting at 1st level, you may rapidly recover your mana by attuning yourself to the flows of magic.
You can use your action and bonus action on your turn to regain mana as if completed a short rest
(or rested for one hour).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. You regain
expended uses when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, the flow of raw mana protects
you, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting you advantage to saving
throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

Alternatively, if you use this during a short rest or when you are below one-quarter your maximum
mana point pool, you are treated as if you rested for two hours instead of one. This is atop the
mana you regain for the normal rest.

##### Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first
glimmerings of your true power.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A mage can conjure and bind aberrations, celestials, constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, oozes, and
undead, as well homunculi creatures (creatures with the homunculus template).

##### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level mage spells of your choice. When you
level up, you gain 2 additional mage spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by
research, tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each mage level provides you with 1 caster level in the mage class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the mage spell
list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells by consulting your spellbook after a long rest.

Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute per spell level for
each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your mage spells, since you learn your mage spells
through dedicated study and memorization.

You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Intelligence modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Intelligence modifier

##### Ritual Casting
You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your
spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your mage spells.

##### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook. You do not
gain spells by default, and typically scribe spells from scrolls into your own spellbook, or purchase
(or steal) the spellbooks of others, or research them yourself.

#### Mage Tradition
When you reach 2nd level, you choose a mage tradition, shaping your practice of magic through
one of eight schools, or through the disciplines of Arcane, Fire, or Frost, detailed at the end of the
class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th
level.

The most common traditions in Azeroth are the three below: Arcane, Fire, and Frost. Arcane and
Frost are preferred by the students and people of Dalaran, but the grand power of Fire is nothing to
be ignored. Other than the above specializations, the Necromancy and Conjuration schools (as
described in the core rulebook) are common in Azeroth.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will with
no mana cost. Choose a 2nd-level and one 3rd-level mage spell that are in your spellbook.

You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending mana when you have them
prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level (or if the spell consumes mana in its
description), you must expend mana as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different
spells of the same levels.

#### Signature Spell
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little
effort. Choose two 4th-level mage spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have
these spells prepared, they don‘t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can
cast each of them once at 4th level without expending mana. When you do so, you can‘t do so
again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend mana as normal.

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

### Arcane
You manipulate focused mysterious arcane and raw mana powers more adeptly than others,
destroying enemies with overwhelming raw magic force. Arcane mages adopt a more scholarly
persona than other mages.

#### Arcane Spheres
Starting at 2nd level, you gain one Arcane Sphere whenever one of the following
happens to you:
* You deal arcane damage to an enemy with a mage ability or spell from the mage list
* You lose at least 4 mana points by being target of the mana burn or detonate mana spells or
absorbing damage via the mana shield spell. If absorbing damage by the mana shield spell,
you gain one Arcane Sphere for each 4 mana points lost this way.
* You suffer an attack from another Mystic Blast or similar ability (usually called Mystic, Fire,
Arcane, or Shadow Blasts), unless it is fel damage (in which case you do not gain a sphee).

This applies once per spell. Arcane Spheres may be used to empower your abilities. Arcane Spheres
may be spent for the following.
* Augmenting Arcana. Deal 1 additional point of arcane damage per damage dice with mage
spells and abilities that deal arcane damage. This can be spent after rolling for damage, and
applies once per spell. This does not stack with similar abilities.
* Mana Circulation. You may substitute 1 Arcane Sphere for 1 mana point (cannot reduce
mana point loss beyond 1) for effects that consume mana (such as spells or mana burn and
similar effects).

You may have a maximum number of spheres equal to 2 plus your Proficiency bonus, and they
remain for one hour after being acquired.

#### Arcane Power Mastery
Also starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to unleash blasts of arcane
force as an action. You gain the Mystic Blast feat. Unlike the normal Mystic Blast feat, this only
deals arcane damage.

You also always have the mana shield spell prepared, and whenever you cast the spell, you gain
temporary hit points equal to your Arcane Blast damage until the spell ends.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:320px;"></div>

#### Presence of Mind
Starting at 6th level, you may store bits of your mental focus and concentration
over the day, and then discharge the stored potential to cast a spell. When you cast a mage spell
that has a casting time of 1 action, it instead becomes a bonus action. You can cast two spells in
one round this way, and are not restricted to cantrips. For this purpose, Mystic Blast counts as a
spell.

Once this ability is used a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, it cannot be used
again until after a long or short rest.

#### Arcane Power
Starting at 10th level, you can open yourself to latent arcane energies with an
action, channeling power you would normally be unable to channel. For the next minute, every
mage spell you cast costs 1 less mana point (minimum 1 mana). If the spell is heightened from a
lower spell level, it costs 2 less points instead. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again
until after a short or long rest, or unless you spend 4 Arcane spheres.

#### Focus Power
Starting at 14th level, you can choose to re-use arcane energies that normally
dissipate into the ether when casting spells. Whenever you affect a target by a mage spell on your
turn, you can also make an Arcane Blast attack without spending an action. This can be used once
per turn, regardless of how many targets you affect by your spell, and can only be added to spells
two levels lower than your highest-level spell.

If the spell has a duration more than instantaneous, you can instead choose to deliver the damage
at any point of the duration instead of after instantaneously striking the target (up to a maximum
of the end of the spell‘s duration).

The damage of the Arcane Blast is added to the total damage despite being of a different type (and
is counted as one attack; thus, if the original spell had a saving throw to negate or half damage, the
extra damage is negated or halved appropriately).

### Fire
You ignite enemies with bolts of flame and exploding fire, heating up until you deliver the final
strike. Fire mages are well-appreciated engines of destruction in war.

#### Controlled Destruction
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the
effects of your fire evocation spells. When you cast a fire evocation spell that affects other creatures
that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + your intelligence modifier. The
chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no
damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

Also, for a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, your fire evocation spells can be used
to set a target single on fire, inflicting the burning condition on a failed Stamina saving throw. The
burning damage is equal to 1d6 points of fire damage, or one-quarter the number of dice the spell
dealt (whichever is higher).

You may use multiple uses on a single spell. You regain all spent uses at the end of a short rest.

#### Student of Flame
Also beginning at 2nd level, you may scribe evocation spells with other energy
types as fire spells in your spellbook. The spells act the same way, unless the DM rules it is
unreasonable (such as a slippery effect on a fire sleet spell). You also gain resistance to fire damage.

Scorch. Starting at 6th level, you may cast fire bolt as a bonus action. Also, you may critically hit
with any ranged fire spell attack on a 19 and a 20, dealing double damage. Also, whenever a
creature suffers the burning condition from your fire spells, they also have disadvantage to ability
checks so long as the condition remains.

#### Black Fire
Starting at 10th level, you may spend a bonus action and curse a creature within 30 feet
with black flame, reducing its resistance to fire damage. The creature must succeed on a Stamina
saving throw or fall to the hex for 1 minute. If it is immune to fire damage, it becomes resistant
instead. If resistant, it takes fire damage normally.

If it doesn't have immunity nor resistance, you (and only you) instead deal bonus fire damage to
them equal to half your level. This applies once per spell or effect.

A creature cannot be subjected to this effect more than once for 24 hours. You can only affect one
creature with this ability at any given time.

#### Pyromaniac
At 14th level, you add the pyroblast spell to your spellbook if it isn‘t already within it.

Whenever you critically hit with a ranged fire spell, you may spend a bonus action to gain one
round of concentration on the pyroblast spell for each critical hit. The pyromaniac bonus remains
for one hour or until you cast the spell, and stacks with itself. It cannot exceed the maximum
damage you can deal with spell, however. For this purpose, you count as if you critically hit if one
of the targets of your fire spells fails by a natural 1-2 on a saving throw, or if you score a natural 19-
20 on a ranged attack with a fire spell.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/j0RJ7pI.png' style='position:absolute; bottom:0px; left:-50px; width:100%; height:100%;' />

### Frost
You debilitate and freeze your enemies in their tracks, before shattering them with ice magic or
entombing them in it for eternity. Frost mages are usually explorers, as their ability to debilitate,
slow, and evade foes gives them survivability that makes them natural to the task.

#### Chilling Effects
Starting at 2nd level, you may use a bonus action to inflict the chilled condition to
any target of your cold spells for one round. The condition stacks as normal, even with spells that
already chill the enemy. If multiple creatures are chilled, choose a number equal to your
Intelligence modifier.

#### Student of Frost
Also beginning at 2nd level, you may scribe evocation spells with other energy
types as cold spells in your spellbook. The spells act the same way, unless the DM rules it is
unreasonable (such as a burning effect on a cold spell). You also gain resistance to cold damage.

#### Ice Lance
Starting at 6th level, you know the frost bolt cantrip, and can always cast it as a bonus
action. You can also use this cantrip if you already cast a spell in the same round.

Also, you can create a path of frost over water (or any liquid that freezes at a similar temperature)
with any spell that deals cold damage (including cantrips). This freezes a number of consecutive 5-
foot squares equal to double the spell level (or a single square if a cantrip).

The frozen path melts away in one minute (or may not if the weather is at below freezing). The path
can also be broken by spending 5 feet of movement for every 5-foot square.

#### White Ice
Starting at 10th level, you may spend a bonus action and curse a creature within 30 feet
with white ice, reducing its resistance to cold damage. The creature must succeed on a Stamina
saving throw or fall to the hex for 1 minute.

If it is immune to cold damage, it becomes resistant instead. If resistant, it takes cold damage
normally. If it doesn't have immunity nor resistance, you (and only you) instead deal bonus cold
damage to them equal to half your level. This applies once per spell or effect.

A creature cannot be subjected to this effect more than once for 24 hours. You can only affect one
creature with this ability at any given time.

#### Ice Statues
At 14th level, whenever you a target of your mage spells is restrained by having their
speed reduced to 0 by the chilled condition, they are also incapacitated for the duration of the
chilled condition. Against such targets, your frost bolt cantrip is automatically a critical hit if it
successfully hits, but the chilled condition ends prematurely (and is not applied for frost bolt).

Also, whenever you deal damage to a creature that exceeds one-half their maximum hit points at
once, they are both restrained and incapacitated for one hour (or until they thaw out, whichever
comes first). Both effects end prematurely if the target is hit.

<div style="margin-top:410px;"></div>

## Monk (MNK)

*Witnessing an orc and a human locked in battle on his
land, a pandaren intervenes. Expertly placing his staff
between the two combatants and intercepting, he parries
every one of their blows, using their own attacks against
them. Without landing a single attack on his adversaries, he
emerges triumphant.*
<br><br>
*An ancient temple lays atop the snowy peak of a mountain,
the violent winds cut away at the pandaren‘s face as she
meditates. She can feel the balance of the world, the good
and bad, the calm and the rage, the silence and the storm.
The mists slowly curl around her paws, filling her shivering
body with warmth, soothing her aching muscles and lifting
her broken spirit.*
<br><br>
*The wildhammer dwarf gathers power into himself, tattoos on his back shimmering. He then
releases a single powerful blow that shatters a stone larger than he. He then turns to the three orcs
hiding in the bushes, and smirks as they flee, leaving their weapons behind.*
<br><br>
When the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the monks that brought
hope to a seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these
pandaren instead focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the
opportunity for revolution struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression.
Dwarves and tauren are also familiar with the way of the monk, although they know it as runeweaving.

### Masters of the Mind
Experts of bare-handed combat, monks never rely solely on the need to have a weapon in their
hands to defend against their enemies. Although most widely known to the outside world for their
fearsome jabs and flying kicks, they refuse to limit themselves to a single method of combat.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:430px;"></div>

Many monks prefer instead to ―soak it up‖ and seem to revel in the intoxicating effect of absorbing
blow after blow while their companions press the attack. Other monks specialize in calling upon
the restorative power of the mists to balance the good and bad energy within people, returning
them to good health and fortune. Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most
monastic traditions call chi.

This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that
flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects
and exceed their bodies‘ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow
of chi in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their
unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of chi gives them
more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

### Discipline and Harmony
Monks bring a unique martial arts style to any fight, and harness an exotic form of magical energy
that‘s unfamiliar to those who practice other arcane arts. They seek spiritual balance in life and in
combat, and as dangerous as monks can be on the battlefield, they‘re rarely looking to pick a fight
without just cause.

They view the world through a different lens, finding power through serenity and inner peace—then
expressing it through artful combat techniques and powers that mend life. Perhaps most
surprisingly, Monks are also adept at producing powerful brews they consume to aid them in battle.

Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that
might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies
or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.

### Creating a Monk
The Monks of Azeroth usually follow Pandaren monastery tradition, ever since they were
subjugated by the mogu. They usually act independently from factions, seeing the ebb and flow of
right and wrong to belong with neither sides, and can be found in the most unusual of places,
seeking wisdom or enlightenment.

As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you
learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the
monastery‘s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service
performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or
did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important
mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the
community‘s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to
accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home? If you are a dwarf or
tauren, do you follow the old ways of rune-weaving? Why have you chosen this path over others,
and how do you compare your ancient traditions with the more structured beliefs of the pandaren
monks?

As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness
chi, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

\pagebreakNum

#### Martial Arts
At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes
and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don‘t have the twohanded or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you
aren‘t wearing armor or wielding a shield:
* You can use Agility instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed
strikes and monk weapons.
* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.
This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial column of the Monk table. If you
have a greater damage die, you may choose that instead.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn,
you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and
attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you
haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a
nunchaku (club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain) or a kama (sickle with a
shorter, straighter blade), or even a large tankard of alcohol (club). Whatever name you use for a
monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

#### Ki
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki (or Chi within
Pandaren circles). Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. You have a
number of Ki points equal to your monk level.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry
of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in
this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of
which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself.

You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki
features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature‘s effects.
The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
<br><br>
**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier.

##### Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two
unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

##### Patient Defense
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

##### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and
your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

\columnbreak

##### Casting Ki Spells
Some monk abilities allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and
other rules, but you don‘t need to provide material components for it. You can spend additional ki
points to the original value to increase the level of the spell that you cast, provided that the spell
has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for
each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level Brewmaster and use Breath
of Fire to cast burning hands, you can spend 2 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell or 3 ki and cast
it as a 3rd level spell. The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way
(including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is
determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table. Your effective
spellcasting ability score is Spirit. 

#### Monk Talent
Starting at 2nd level, you gain a class talent, representing your various special abilities, either by use
of Ki, natural grace in movement, or esoteric fighting techniques. See Class Talents at the end of
the Chapter 3 for options.

Whenever you qualify for another talent (as detailed in the talent column), you can choose another
talent or gain another use of an existing talent.

#### Monk Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monk tradition: the way of the Brewmaster,
who excels in mysterious drinks, the way of the Mistweaver, who heals themselves and others, or
the way of the Windwalker, the adventurous and evasive combatant.

All traditions are detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at
3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

As normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn.

#### Stunning Strike
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent‘s body. When you hit
another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning
strike. The target must succeed on a Stamina saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next
turn. Despite the name, this is not a strike effect.

#### Ki-Empowered Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming
resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

#### Stillness of Mind
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be
charmed or frightened.

\pagebreakNum

#### Purity of Body
At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and
poison.

Furthermore, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and
take the second result.

#### Tongue of the Sun and Moon
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken
languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

#### Timeless Body
At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be
aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

#### Empty Body
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1
minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but arcane damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material
components. When you do so, you can‘t take any other creatures with you.

#### Perfect Self
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

### Brewmaster
You are focused on evading blows and empowering themselves and your allies through your brews.
Brewmasters make the most common of monk adventurers.

#### Brewmaster Focus
Upon reaching 3rd level and gaining this monk tradition, you may add the
following Ki power to your repertoire.

##### Breath of Fire
As an action, you can spend 1 Ki to cast the burning hands spell. This
requires only verbal components. You can spend additional Ki to heighten the spell.

#### Drunken Style Stance [Stance]
Also starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to enter the
drunken style stance. So long as you are in this stance, use of the Step of the Wind Ki ability does
not spend Ki. Furthermore, due to your consistent drunken interventions, a target successfully
struck by one of your melee weapon attacks has have disadvantage to attack rolls to attacks that do
not target you, and reduces its spell DCs and spell attack bonus by 4 points if the spell does not
include you.

This stance is broken if you move more than your normal speed in a single round.

#### Brewmaster Ki
Upon reaching 6th level, you gain the following new Ki powers and add them to
your repertoire.

##### Purifying Touch [Strike]
As an action, you can spend 3 Ki and cast the dispel magic spell.

This requires touching the effect or creature that is subject to the effect. You may use this as a
touch or as a strike effect. You can spend additional Ki to heighten the spell. If you end a spell this
way, you regain a number of Ki points equal to the dispelled spell‘s level (if dispelling multiple
spells, choose only the highest-level spell). This cannot restore more Ki than double the amount
spent on the ability.

##### Brewmaster’s Stagger
As a reaction, you may spend 2 Ki and stagger damage done to you,
spreading the damage over multiple rounds. You suffer one-quarter the damage you would

\columnbreak 

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

normally suffer. At the start of your turn in the next round, you suffer another one-quarter. This
continues at the start of your turn every round until you spread the damage over a total of four
rounds (suffering one-quarter every round). If you would stagger damage when at 0 hit points, you
automatically fail your death saving throw. You cannot stagger damage unless you are benefitting
from Unarmored Defense.

Whenever you choose to stagger damage while in Drunken Style Stance, you may direct any excess
healing you would benefit to the pool of staggered damage.

#### Brewmaster’s Sturdiness
Also starting at 6th level, you can use your weight to enhance your blows
and deflect attacks.

Your AC increases by one-half your Strength modifier, and you may add 3 points of damage to all
your melee attacks that are modified by Strength so long as you are above half your carrying
capacity. You must benefit from Unarmored Defense to make use of this ability.

#### Ox Stance [Stance]
Starting at 11th level, you may enter this stance as a bonus action by spending
2 Ki. While in this stance, you may add your Spirit modifier to all saving throws, and you are
enhanced with greater resilience. You may stagger damage twice for no cost, and whenever you
choose to stagger damage while in this stance, you suffer one less round of damage (suffering a total
of three-quarters damage). Furthermore, you do not automatically fail death saving throws from
triggered by staggered damage.

Also, the first time you enter this stance, you gain temporary hit points equal to double your level.

If you succeed on an Agility or Strength saving throw against an effect and take no damage, you
may enter this stance for only 1 Ki point, as a reaction.

This stance is also broken if you move more than your normal speed in a single round.

#### Zen Pose
Starting at 17th level, your Ox Stance is enhanced into Zen Pose. So long as you do not
take damage from an attack and do not fail a saving throw, your enemies have disadvantage to
attack rolls against you, and you have advantage to all saving throws. Whenever both rolls (from
advantage or disadvantage) are resolved to your benefit while in the pose (such as an attack failing
once normally and again due to disadvantage), you regain 1 Ki point.

<div style="margin-top:250px;"></div>

### Mistweaver
You are focused on empowering and supporting allies. Mistweavers are usually the most elusive of
the monk disciplines.

#### Mistweaver Focus
Upon reaching 3rd level and gaining this monk tradition, you may add the
following Ki power to your repertoire.

##### Soothing Mist
As an action, you may expend Ki and gain a cloud of healing mists. The
creature gains 2d6 hit points for every Ki point invested. You may target a creature up to 15 feet
away (or a number of creatures within 30 feet of one another), and distribute healing amongst as
many creatures as you wish. If benefitting from Thunder Focus Tea, this ability heals 5 extra hit
points.

If you already used your action to attack a hostile creature and landed at least one successful hit on
your turn in the last round, you may use this ability as a bonus action instead.

You may alternatively expend hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease
or neutralize one poison affecting it, with a number of hit points required equal to one-half the
saving throw DC of the poison (round up). You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple
poisons with a single use of Soothing Mist, expending hit points separately for each one. This
feature has no effect on constructs or undead.

##### Enveloping Mist
As an action, you can spend 1 Ki to cast the rejuvenation or expeditious
retreat spells as 1st level spells. These requires only verbal components. You can spend additional Ki
to heighten the spells.

Mistweaver’s Enlightenment. Also upon gaining this monk tradition, whenever you deal damage
to a target, you are enhanced with enlightenment for until the end of your turn in the next round.

You may either reduce the Ki cost of an ability you use by 1 point (minimum 1 point), or use the
Soothing Mist Ki power with no expenditure of Ki. This heals as if you spent 1 Ki point only, but
cannot heal a creature above its Bloodied value. 

#### Mistweaver Ki
Upon reaching 6th level, you gain the following new Ki powers and add them to
your repertoire.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:270px;"></div>

##### Control Ki
As an action, you may spend 2 Ki to cast the mute spell. Upon reaching 9th
level, you may also cast dispel magic as a 3rd level spell. You may either cast them with their normal
ranges, use them as strike effects, or imbue them into your brews if you have the Brewer feat. In
this case, they are the only imbued effect. You can spend Ki to heighten this effect.

If the target of your mute spell fails their saving throw or if your dispel magic spell successfully dispels
a spell, you regain 1 Ki.

##### Mist Weave
As an action, you can spend 2 Ki to cast the fog cloud and blink step spells as
2nd level spells. You can spend Ki to heighten this effect. If you use the blink step spell to end
adjacent to an ally and target them with your Soothing Mist ability, you regain half the Ki you
spend on the ability.

Furthermore, so long as you have at least 2 Ki, you suffer only light obstruction, and never heavy
obstruction from mist and fog.

#### Mistweaver’s Peace
Also starting at 6th level, you can spend 3 Ki to cast the barrier ward spell as a
3rd level spell. Furthermore, if a creature fails to force its way through the barrier or attempts to
deal damage to the barrier, it is pushed 10 feet away from the barrier. If attempting to damage the
barrier, the target is pushed only if they fail a Strength saving throw against your Ki DC. 

#### Life Cocoon
Starting at 11th level, you may spend 2 Ki points designate an allied creature with a
cocoon of Ki as an action, which remains for 1 minute. While invigorated this way, the creature
gains 3d10 temporary hit points. So long as the temporary hit points remain, the target heals 50%
more hit points from healing effects.

A creature cannot benefit from life cocoon more than once every 24 hours. You may use this ability
on yourself while stunned or asleep, but not while incapacitated.

#### Enlightenment
Starting at 17th level, you may spend 7 Ki to cast the resurrection spell, or 4 Ki to
cast the revivify spell. Once the resurrection spell is cast, you cannot cast it again until you complete a
short rest, regardless if you have Ki remaining.

Furthermore, your Life Cocoon ability grants 5d10 temporary hit points instead of 3d10, and a
creature can benefit once per a short rest.

### Windwalker
You are focused on hand-to-hand combat and evasion of the enemy‘s blows. Windwalkers are
usually the most confrontational of the monk disciplines.

#### Windwalker Focus
Upon reaching 3rd level and gaining this monk tradition, you may add the
following Ki power to your repertoire.

##### Superior Martial Arts
As an action, you may spend 2 Ki and deal a single unarmed attack
roll as an area of effect (expending any number of attacks). You may choose to make it a 5-footburst around you (Hurricane Kick), a 10-foot cone (Fists of Fury), or a 15-foot line (Flying Serpent
Kick). You may move within the specified area of effect without provoking reactions from the
creatures in the area of effect (such as kicking through a line of enemies and landing behind them
with a Flying Serpent Kick, or shifting 5 feet to the right after a Hurricane Kick, or moving 10 feet
to one side after a Fists of Fury). Creatures affected can attempt an Agility saving throw against your
Ki DC to half the damage.

This action counts as if you made a single unarmed attack for the purposes of your Martial Arts
feature and Flurry of Blows ability.

#### Windwalker Grace
Also upon gaining this monk tradition, whenever you deal damage to a target,
you can use your Step of the Wind Ki ability without spending a Ki point.

#### Windwalker Ki
Upon reaching 6th level, you gain the following new Ki powers and add them to
your repertoire.

##### Destroy Mana [Strike]
As an action, you may spend 2 Ki to cast the mana burn spell. This
requires touching the effect or creature that is subject to the effect, and does not require vocal
components. You can choose to make this ability destroy Ki instead, in which case it removes half
the mana points it would normally remove. You may treat this as a strike effect. You can spend Ki
to heighten this effect.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:350px;"></div>

##### Rising Sun [Strike].
As a bonus action, you may perform an upwards kick, dealing
unarmed damage and imposing an additional effect. You may also choose between dealing extra
2d6 damage, or adding 1d6 to any melee weapon attack you make against the target for the next
minute. If the target succeeds on a Strength saving throw, they take half the 2d6 extra damage, or,
if you chose the second option, ignore the extra damage.

#### Combo Attacks
Starting at 11th level, you score a critical hit with your weapon attacks on a 19-20.

If you already possess this range, the range increases by 1 point to 18-20. When you score a critical
hit, you may either use any one Ki ability with no action or Ki cost (such as flurry of blows, Rising
Sun, your Superior Martial Arts abilities, or Quivering Palm once you gain it), or choose to regain 2
Ki.

#### Quivering Palm
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone‘s body.

When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can use a bonus action and 3 Ki to start these
imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations
are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the
same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Stamina saving throw.

If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 shadow damage instead. You
may place these vibrations even with a harmless touch (which may require a Charisma (Deception)
check contested to a Spirit (Insight) check).

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end

## Paladin (PLD)
*A draenei pores over an ancient libram, moving its pages by his
mere will. Summoning a blessing, he shuts the tome as light
arises from his hooves to the heavens. Hefting his crystalline
greathammer, he exits, aware that his return is unlikely at best.*
<br><br>
*Huddled together, two young orcs cower as a fierce dragon
lands with a resounding crash atop the chieftain‘s hut. She roars
before spewing liquid fire upon the great watchtower, revealing
the orcs in the light. She releases a blast of flame at them—but
then stops. The red inferno dissipates to reveal tauren clad in
golden plate, holding aloft a mighty shield that blocked her fire. Telling the orcs to run, the tauren
prepares himself to face the dragon alone, satisfied he has bought the young orcs the time they
needed to escape.*
<br><br>
*A human rides through haunted plague-lands on a wounded steed. As he nears an abandoned
barn, hisses are from undead throats, as six ghouls skulk from the interior of the barn. The rider
raises a bare hand, causing a burst of holy light to rise from the earth to burn the ghouls. After his
deed is done, the rider continues on, the land still marked with his power, temporarily freed from
unholy blight.*
<br><br>
This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish
evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so
they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds
and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:520px;"></div>

### The Cause of Righteousness
Paladins are virtuous defenders of the weak, and tireless, unfaltering enemies of the undead.
Mixing elements of the warrior and the clerics of the Holy Light, the paladin is a tough melee
fighter.

The paladin is a warrior of the Holy Light. They uphold all that is good and true in the world and
revile all that is evil and sinister, especially undead and the Burning Legion. They offer succor to
the beleaguered and smite their enemies with holy fervor. They are particularly potent against
undead, as these creatures threaten the goodly races and the Holy Light burns them terribly. The
presence of any evil is reprehensible to paladins, but they focus their efforts on destroying undead
and demons.

These warriors uphold the tenets of the Holy Light and defend their factions from the predations
of any threat. Found in almost every corner of Azeroth fighting the forces of evil and barbarism,
these stalwart warriors of faith ceaselessly uphold their vigil against demonic forces from beyond the
Dark Portal. Paladins are the embodiment of good and selfless dedication to the protection of their
peoples. They help the innocent and punish the wicked. As such, paladins are generally of good
alignment.

### Bexond the Mundane Life
Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken
him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic
struggle against evil.

\pagebreakNum

Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer
people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn
from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into
the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to
the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country. Adventuring paladins take their work
seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose
than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest
victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.

### Creating a Paladin
The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although
the class features related to your oath don‘t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that
choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class.

Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor
venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the Light, cherishing everything
beautiful that stands against the shadow? Are you a defender who can stand before sea of foes
without flinching? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to deliver retribution on those who have
done great evil?

#### Quick Build
You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your
highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the noble background. Third, choose
the following 1st-level spells for your libram: compelled duel, holy light, and seal array (righteousness).

### Class Features
As a paladin, you have the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per paladin level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Stamina modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Stamina modifier per paladin level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None
___
- **Saving Throws:** Stamina, Charisma
- **Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Deception, and Religion.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a martial weapon and a shield or *(b)* two martial weapons
- *(a)* five javelins or *(b)* any simple melee weapon
- *(a)* a priest‘s pack or *(b)* an explorer‘s pack
- Chain mail, a holy symbol, and a holy libram
 
\columnbreak

#### Special

##### Seal Spells
Paladins are the only class that can access the seal array spell, and can prepare different seals for
strike effects. Seals are magical enhancements that can enhance a paladin‘s weapon attacks, and can
be released in coordination with the Crusader Strike ability to cause a devastating strike.

</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings
like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces.

Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60
feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any
being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the lich Kel‘Thuzad, for instance). Within the
same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or
desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your
Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

#### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can cure wounds. As an action, you may lay your hands on a target, investing
them with healing energies. For every mana point you spend for Lay on Hands, you heal a number
of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. Amount you heal is instead treated as holy damage
for undead and fiends (in which case, this requires a melee spell attack). Excess hit points are lost,
and you cannot heal or deal more damage than a value equal to your maximum hit points. When
performing Lay on Hands on yourself, this is instead a bonus action.

Alternatively, you can expend the mana to cure one disease or one poison of your choice. Each
disease or poison requires spending mana points equal to one-quarter the saving throw DC of the
poison or disease. You may cure multiple diseases or poisons this way. This feature has no effect on
constructs.

You gain a mana pool as if you were a second level paladin (see the Spellcasting feature below), with
the pool size as if you had no access to 1st level spells.

#### Crusader Strike
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend mana as
if you cast a spell to deal holy damage to the target, in addition to the weapon‘s damage. The extra
damage is 1d8 plus 1d8 per spell level (maximum 6d8 with a 5th level spell). If the target is a fiend
or an undead, you gain +5 to the strike‘s damage.

If you have a seal active, you may also perform a Crusader Strike without expending mana (called
Seal Release or Judgment), terminating the effects of the seal (plus an additional effect depending
on the seal). Despite the name, Crusader Strike does not count as a Strike effect.

#### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.
You can‘t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
* **Defense** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are
wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have
the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Protection** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use
your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

#### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast
spells as a priest does.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A paladin can conjure and bind celestials.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each paladin level provides you with 0.5 caster levels in the paladin class (minimum 0). You follow
the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You can also change your list of prepared spells by consulting your libram (treat as a spellbook)
after a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute
per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the
strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a
paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier

##### Spellbook – Libram
At 2nd level, your libram contains three 1st-level paladin spells of your choice. When you level up,
you gain 2 additional paladin spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research,
tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your libram is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by scribing it with new insights
regarding the faith and how to protect and promote it.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your holy libram as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells, as well as the store for
them.

#### Aura
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery over aura spells begins to manifest. You always have the following
aura spells prepared.
* At 3rd level, you always have the devotion aura spell prepared.
* At 6th level, you always have the retribution aura spell prepared.
* At 10th level, you always have the crusader aura spell prepared.
* At 14th level, you always have the concentration aura spell prepared.
* At 18th level, you always have the resistance aura spell prepared.

\pagebreakNum

Furthermore, you may cast each of the above aura spells for no cost once upon reaching the
described level. You regain all expended uses after a short rest.

#### Holy Oath
When you reach 3rd level, you walk a path that defines you as a paladin forever. Up to this time
you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it.

You may choose the Oath of Holiness to aid the helpless, Oath of Protection to guard the weak, or
Oath of Retribution to smite the wicked, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features
include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

##### Oath Spells
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the
oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells
don‘t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn‘t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a
paladin spell for you.

##### Channel Divinity
Your path allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity
option provided by your path explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you
choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this
class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

You may always Turn Undead, and you gain an additional choice from your Path.

##### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using
your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must
make a Spirit saving throw.

If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned
creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can‘t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can‘t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there‘s nowhere to
move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

As normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
on your turn.

\columnbreak

#### Divine Health
Starting at 6th level, the divine magics flowing within you grant you immunity to diseases and
advantage against poison, as well as resistance against poison damage.

#### Improved Crusader Strike
By 11th level, you are so suffused with the might of the Light that all your melee weapon strikes
carry its divine power with it. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes
an extra 1d8 holy damage. If you also use your Crusader Strike with an attack, you add this damage
to the extra damage of your Crusader Strike.

#### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing
creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).
You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Aura Improvement
Also starting at 18th level, you have advantage to any check to maintain an aura, and may extend
the range of any aura spell by 100%. Any effect that would normally dispel the aura instead
suppresses it for 1 minute instead.

<div style="margin-top:400px;"></div>

### Oath of Holiness
Your oath is to heal and inspire your allies. Holy paladins are common, and are usually wellregarded battle healers.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Oath of Holiness Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Protection from evil and good, sanctuary |
| 5th | Lesser restoration, zone of truth |
| 9th | Beacon of hope, revivify (or redemption) |
| 13th | Freedom of movement, guardian of faith |
| 17th | Commune, mass revivify (or mass redemption) |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Light of Dawn
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you can spend a Channel
Divinity use and an action, to present your holy symbol and release an outburst of the Holy Light
of Creation, allowing one friendly creature within 30 feet to use a hit dice as if they rested. The ally
also gains temporary hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier.

#### Holy Vision
At 3rd level, whenever you cast a healing spell from the paladin spell list and the dice
shows the maximum possible result (such as a 6 on a d6), you may roll the maximized dice again
and add the amount healed to the total. This applies to healing spells that deal damage to undead.
This does not stack with other similar abilities.

This acts similarly to the Light‘s Insight ability of the holy priesthood. If having both features, and
if the re-rolled dice results in a maximum result as well, you may roll a third time.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:420px;"></div>

#### Holy Auras
At 7th level, your auras increase in strength. You may maintain two aura spells at once
as if they cost one case of concentration. Furthermore, your allies can benefit from two auras at a
time.

Also, whenever an ally is within one of your aura spells, they are more easily healed by you. If you
are using a paladin healing spell, it can heal one additional dice of damage to them. If you are using
the Lay on Hands feature, it can heal 25% extra hit points. If you are using the holy shock spell, it
can heal or deal one additional dice of damage if the target is within one of your aura spells.

#### Latent Prayer
Starting at 15th level, you may cast a healing spell on a creature that only activates
whenever the creature wishes. This does not require concentration on your end, and the creature
(or you) may declare use of the spell as a reaction. This effect remains for one day or until used, and
leaves a holy mark that can be detected as the healing spell. A single creature can only benefit from
one latent prayer until they take a long rest. This may also be applied to undead to harm them (if
possible).

If you use this ability while under the effect of the avatar form paladin spell, you can affect a second
time in the same period.

#### Illuminated Healer
By 20th level, whenever a creature that benefits from a healing effect (such as
Light of Dawn, or healing spell) originating from you manifest a holy shield. This holy shield grants
them temporary hit points equal to the amount they were healed by you.

This shield remains until ten minutes have passed. A creature can benefit from a single holy shield
only once every hour. When you benefit from maximized dice via your Holy Vision feature, you
may roll again (up to twice per instance).

<div style="margin-top:310px;"></div>

### Oath of Protection
Your oath is to guard your allies and all friends of the Holy Light. Protection paladins are very
tough foes who can survive hefty abuse.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Oath of Protection Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Sanctuary, shield |
| 5th | Lesser restoration, warding bond |
| 9th | Beacon of hope, revivify (or redemption) |
| 13th | Aura of life, death ward |
| 17th | hope of healing, wall of force |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity: Rook’s Move
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you may spend a Channel
Divinity use to swap places with any ally as a reaction. Choose an ally that is about to be attacked by
a weapon attack, or an ally who took damage from a weapon attack roll. The two of you change
places, ignoring attacks of opportunity provoked as part of movement and difficult terrain. The ally
must be within 30 feet of you, you must have a clear path to them, and the target must be of your
size category or smaller.

If you use this ability before the attack roll is made, but you must declare use of this ability before
knowing whether the attack would hit the ally. The attack roll is made against your normal AC.

If you declare this ability after the attack roll is successful, the attack is automatically successful, and
you switch places, even if you would have otherwise been unharmed (it such as by having a higher
AC value than the attacker‘s attack roll).

#### Avenger’s Shield
Starting 3rd level, you may throw a shield you are wearing as a ranged thrown
attack (even if it is normally strapped to your arm). The shield acts as a light thrown weapon with a
range of 30/60 feet that deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier in damage. The damage dealt is half holy and half

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:330px;"></div>

bludgeoning, and furthermore the target gains the distracted condition for until the
beginning of your turn in the next round. The shield returns instantaneously to your hand, and
may be used again in the same round if you have multiple attacks.

Also, so long as you are using a shield, you cannot lose concentration on an aura spell due to
damage. The Improved Auras ability grants you advantage to any concentration spell from the
Paladin spell list instead.

#### Opportune Prayer
Starting at 7th level, whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you may
cast a healing spell from the paladin spell list as a reaction (so long as the spell has a maximum
casting time of 1 action). You may also do this whenever you score a critical hit, are hit with a
critical hit, or when reduced to 0 hit points.

Furthermore, so long as you have multiple attacks, you can spend them to allow your Avenger‘s
Shield to target multiple creatures. Regardless if the shield hits or misses, it may target another
creature within 30 feet of the first target (up to one target per attack action spent this way). When
you no longer have any extra attacks or choose to stop the bounce, the shield returns to you.

If you are under the effects of the avatar form paladin spell, you can bounce your shield at one extra
target.

#### Holy Sentinel
Starting at 15th level, your Avenger‘s Shield deals 2d4 points of damage instead of
1d4. Also, whenever you successfully strike a target with the shield, you gain a d4 dice (up to a
maximum number of dice equal to 3d4). If you deal Holy damage or heal at least 1 hit point of
damage with your Paladin spells or your Lay on Hands feature, you may expend the dice and add
the result to your roll.

This applies once per spell.

#### Ardent Defender
At level 20, you may, as a reaction, you may gain resistance to all damage for one
round. Once this feature is used a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, it cannot be
used again until you complete a long rest.

When you no longer have uses of this ability, your Opportune Prayer ability allows you to cast any
paladin spell when it is triggered instead (subject to the same casting time restriction).

<div style="margin-top:380px;"></div>

### Oath of Retribution
Your oath is to bring retribution to the wicked, avenging wrongs made but not settled. Retribution
paladins are often wandering knights, hunting down villains and depraved monsters.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Oath of Retribution Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Compelled duel, heroism |
| 5th | Branding smite, warding bond |
| 9th | Daylight, haste |
| 13th | Death ward, guardian of faith |
| 17th | Aligned weapon (or holy weapon), flame strike (or argent cleansing) |

</div>

#### Channel Divinity
Sword of Light. When you take this oath at 3rd level, you can spend a Channel
Divinity use and an action to imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 1
minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (a minimum bonus
of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot-radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If
the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as a bonus action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this
weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. The light is treated as a light spell of your
highest-level paladin level for the purposes of dispelling darkness.

#### Arm of the Law
At 3rd level, you may perform a Crusader Strike as a ranged spell attack. The
attack has a range of 30 feet, and deals only

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:400px;"></div> 
the holy damage as well as any seal release effects.
If you use a thrown weapon, you can use Crusader Strike at a range of up to 30 feet.

Also, whenever you use Crusader Strike or release a seal, you can Dash as a bonus action, but only
to approach the target of your Crusader Strike or an allied creature within 10 feet of the target.

#### Sword of Truth
Starting at 7th level, you add your Charisma modifier to your melee weapon
damage rolls, and whenever you perform a Crusader Strike, you regain hit points equal to half the
holy damage you dealt using the ability.

Lastly, if you are under the effects of the avatar form paladin spell, you can choose one seal you can
cast, and that seal is cast for no mana cost, and remains active until the avatar form spell ends.

#### Divine Storm
Starting at 15th level, whenever you use a Crusader Strike, you may allow the holy
energies to radiate from you in a blazing storm of holy radiance. All hostile creatures within 5 feet
of you suffer the same holy damage dealt by the Crusader Strike ability. They may halve the damage
on a successful Spirit saving throw against your Spell save DC.

If you released a seal, the release effect is applied only to the initial creature. You also only regain
hit points appropriate to the damage you dealt the initial target.

If you are under the effects of the avatar form paladin spell, you may reroll any 1 or 2 on a damage
dice for your Crusader Strike, and you must choose the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

#### Emancipate
At level 20, your Cleansing Touch ability may be used at a range of 10 feet, and you
may always cast it on yourself, even when otherwise incapacitated.
Furthermore, whenever you have no mana points remaining or uses of Cleaning Touch, you may
spend hit dice to fuel your Crusader Strike feature (up to one hit dice per spell level).

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

## Priest (PRS)
*A human screams in agony as blood gushes from the wound in his chest. A night elf comes to his
aid, whispering a prayer to Elune, before nocking an arrow to her bow. Moonlight breaks through
the tree canopy above, as the gash in the human‘s chest heals closes.*
<br><br>
*As an orc receives arrow after arrow to the chest, he falls to the ground, motionless. Before long, a
yellow-white light shines upon him, and climbs to his feet, revealing a blood elf behind, raising her
staff high, bathed in a similar light.*
<br><br>
*Testing the boundaries of his sanity, a forsaken taps into the power of his psyche and calls to the
Forgotten Shadow, melting the mind of a fanatic bent on scourge his kin from the land.*
<br><br>
Through priests, the divine powers of the Light and Void channel into the world, mending wounds
or wreaking havoc. True mastery of these forces comes through worship to greater beings, such as
Elune, the Old Gods, or even the Holy Light itself. Whether devoted to the Light, or a servant of
the Void Lords, a priest is an ambassador for their deity, imbued by the energies they deliver.

### Agents of Light or Shadow
Wielding the power of the Holy Light, priests can unleash powerful healing energies to restore their
allies and undo harm. Manipulating the shadows from the Void equips a priest with devastating
abilities, able to bring complete chaos, shattering the minds of their foes. Careful balance and
discipline permits a priest to truly master the most absolute energies of the Universe, granting them
the ability to heal through shadow, and harm through the light.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:450px;"></div>

Comprehension of the light allows a priest to heal the most serious of wounds, and even undo
death. The power to wield the light doesn‘t require extensive practice or study, instead relying on
the user‘s faith in their own abilities. Those who follow the ways of the Void were often once
worshippers of the Light. As such, priests are among the most devout people in Azeroth.

A priest is incredibly useful in battle, no matter their discipline. Whether they heal their allies,
protect them from harm altogether, or blast the minds of their enemies into submission, few are
more effective than these devout followers of the Light and Shadow, especially when coupled with
their influence in greater society.

### Servants and Acolytes
Many across Azeroth practice divine magic, regardless of intermediaries, and as such many cults
have formed. Servitude of the Light brings restorative healing powers, while giving oneself to the
Shadow grants power over the mind, shadows and even insanity itself. A priestess of Elune taps
into powers of nature and the balance of sun and moon, while a priest of death calls to the Lich
King to curse his foes.

Whether good or evil, a priest will rarely abandon their cause, often fighting to the death, or
sacrificing themselves in place of an ally. Finding someone as loyal as a priest is a rare thing indeed.

Found all over Azeroth, a priest of the Church of the Holy Light brings healing and restorative
powers in times of peace, and protection in times of war, a true advocate for good. A death priest of
the Lich King or a follower of the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow manipulates the shadows to bring
death and destruction to their enemies, warping their minds into madness, often serving evil
purposes, though not always. A follower of Elune can serve her goddess‘s will, setting out to right
wrongs or to retrieve articles of the faith.

\pagebreakNum

It is not unheard of for servants of the Light to use it for evil. Since the Light responds to belief
that one‘s actions are right, which makes it impossible to wield it in the knowledge that one‘s
action are truly evil.

Absolute faith is crucial to harnessing the Light, which is why priests make excellent servants. Many
priests that have abandoned the Light and have opted to harness darker energies retain their
devotion, and while many question their motives, their faith is unwavering, and they continue to
serve their deity.

### Creating a Priest
Priest of Azeroth are known as priests or clerics, depending on their domains and focus. They
channel their power through their conviction, not through the direct power of their patrons. The
Scarlet Crusade, for example, channel the Holy Light due to their belief in their cause, although
many betray principles the Church of the Holy Light considers tenants of the faith.

As you create your priest, always remember the faith you serve and the ideals your character
conveys. Decide how your character came into the service of that particular faith or cult, such as
through divine intervention or through your character‘s own choosing. Are you renowned as a
devout follower of your deity, a fanatic, a troublemaker? How do others of your faith perceive you?
If you have an ultimate goal, keep it in mind when you advance your character.

Priests may be of any alignment and allegiance.

Priests serve their faith--either that of the Light through the Holy priesthood, the Old Gods though
the Shadow priesthood, the Lich King through the Death priesthood, taking a neutral stance
between the forces of the world with Discipline priesthood, or serving the Moon goddess Elune
through the universally-female Moon priesthood.

#### Quick Build
You can make a priest quickly by following these suggestions. First, Spirit should be your highest
ability score, followed by Strength or Stamina. Second, choose the acolyte background. Third,

\pagebreakNum

#### Priesthood
Choose one priesthood or domain related to your deity: Death (Lich King), Discipline (Balance),
Holy (Holy Light), Moon (Elune), or Shadow (Forgotten Shadow). Each priesthood is detailed at
the end of the class description. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you
choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that
feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

#### Spellcasting
As a practitioner of divine magic, you draw your power from the divines themselves, channeling
their will through your body.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A priest can conjure and bind aberrations, beasts, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, oozes, and
undead, as well homunculi creatures (creatures with the homunculus template).

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each priest level provides you with 1 caster level in the priest class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell
list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells by consulting your libram (treat as a spellbook)
after a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute
per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Spirit is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells, since you learn your priest spells through
dedication to a higher force.

You use your Spirit whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Spirit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier

##### Priesthood Spells
Each priesthood has a list of spells—its priesthood spells—that you gain at the priest levels noted in
the priesthood description. Once you gain a priesthood spell, you always have it prepared, and it
doesn‘t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a priesthood spell that doesn‘t appear on the priest spell list, the spell is nonetheless a
priest spell for you.

##### Spellbook – Libram
At 1st level, your libram contains six 1st-level priest spells of your choice. When you level up, you
gain 2 additional priest spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research, tutelage,
or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your libram is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by scribing in your insights
regarding the secrets of the powers you serve.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

#### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals
10 + your Agility modifier + your Spirit modifier.

#### Desperate Prayer
Starting at 1st level, you may rapidly recover your mana by invoking powers from beyond. You can
use your action and bonus action on your turn to regain mana as if completed a short rest (or
rested for one hour).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. You regain
expended uses when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, your connection to your
chosen power guards you, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting
you advantage to saving throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

Alternatively, if you use this during a short rest or when you are below one-quarter your maximum
mana point pool, you are treated as if you rested for two hours instead of one. This is atop the
mana you regain for the normal rest.

#### Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that
energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Invoke Power and an effect
determined by your priesthood. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels,
as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect
to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class,
the DC equals your priest spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity
twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests. When you
finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

##### Channel Divinity: Invoke Power
As a bonus action, you present your symbol and speak a prayer to your patron power, filling you
with mysterious strength. The next spell you cast within 1 minute has its mana cost reduced 2
points (minimum 0). At higher levels, the invocation further reduces the mana cost.

##### Invoke Power Table
| Priest Level | Invocation Strength |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 5 | 3
| 8 | 4
| 11 | 5
| 14 | 6
| 17 | 7

\pagebreakNum

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Divine Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is
great.

Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower
than your priest level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the
effect of any priest spell or priesthood spell would be appropriate.

Imploring your deity‘s aid requires you to use your action.

If your deity intervenes, you can‘t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again
after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll
required.

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

### Death Priesthood
You follow the Lich King, gaining unholy powers from your devotion to the Dark Lord of the
Dead. Death priesthoods are feared and reviled figures in civilized societies, as they are often seen
as harbingers for a Scourge invasion.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Death Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Bane, sleep |
| 3rd | Gentle repose, see invisibility |
| 5th | Conjure undead (animate undead), speak with dead |
| 7th | Blight, drain life |
| 9th | Contagion, unhallow |

</div>

#### Death Can Wait
At first level, you gain advantage against all Death Saving Throws, attempts to
stabilize, and saves against necromancy spell effects.

You may also sacrifice yourself ritually to become a shade, gaining incorporeality (see Introduction),
but becoming unable to cast spells. You gain telepathy with who sacrificed you, and may
communicate with them and share what you see as an action from their part. This remains so long
as you and your lord are in the same plane. The connection may be willingly transferred to another
creature. The transformation is complete after one day of death, and cannot be reversed short of a
wish spell or divine intervention.

#### Lich King’s Favor
Starting at 2nd level, you add all necromancy spells from all spell lists to your
spell list. Using necromancy spells that are not on your spell list cost 1 additional mana point.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Living
Also starting at 2nd level, you can, as an action, present your
symbol and speak a prayer censuring the living. Each living creature that can see or hear you within
30 feet of you must 

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:320px;"></div>

make a Spirit saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for
1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's
nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

When you reach 5th level, you can also outright destroy the living you turn with this feature.
When a living creature fails its saving throw against your Turn Living feature, the creature is
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Turn
Living table. It disintegrates, leaving only a pile of dust, so commands the Lich King.

##### Turn Living Table
| Priest Level | Destroys Living of CR |
|:---:|:---:|
| 5th | 1/2 or lower
| 8th | 1 or lower
| 11th | 2 or lower
| 14th | 3 or lower
| 17th | 4 or lower

#### Cultist of the Damned
Starting at 6th level, you can cast any Necromancy spell as a ritual even if it
doesn't have the ritual tag.

#### Death's Touch
At 8th level, you may use an action to target any dying creature within 90 feet with
a ranged spell attack. The creature fails one death saving throw instantly. You also have Resistance
to shadow damage.

#### Avatar of Death
At 17th level you have the ―Command Undead‖ ability as if you were a
Necromancer equal to your priest level. Also, whenever you defeat a creature using a necromancy
spell, they cannot be resurrected or reincarnated so long as you have not dropped to 0 hit points

### Discipline Priesthood
You follow the tenets of balance and self-improvement, balancing the forces of Light and Shadow
within you—a concept often called Chakra training. Your magics can shield allies from taking
damage as well as heal their wounds. Discipline priests do not advertise themselves, but act as other
priests.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Discipline Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Arcane armor, sanctuary |
| 3rd | Aid (or power word fortitude), levitate |
| 5th | Remove curse, warding bond |
| 7th | Death ward, stoneskin |
| 9th | Hold (up to 4 creature types), telekinesis |

</div>

#### Chakra Ward
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield,
you take 3 less damage from all slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage (minimum 1).
Extended Wards. Also beginning at 1st level, you double the duration of any active spell that
grants temporary hit points and all Power Word spells.

#### Channel Divinity: Atonement
Starting at level 2, you may, as an action, use a channel divinity
attempt to grant any ally within 30 ft. a polar link to your spells. Whenever you deal damage via a
priest spell to a target within 30 feet of the warded ally, the warded creature regains Hit Points
equal to 2 + the spell‘s level (or only 2 for a cantrip). This effect remains for one minute.

This feature has no effect if the mana cost of the spell has been reduced to 0.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:300px;"></div>

#### Channel Divinity: Penance
Starting at level 2, you may, as an action, use channel divinity to
enhance up to 3 targets within 30 ft. with Penance until the end of your turn in the next round. If
a target who benefits from Penance takes damage, you can choose to grant that target resistance
against any damage type you specify, and end the Penance effect for the remaining targets. If all the
targets suffer damage at the same time (such as from an area of effect ability or spell), they all
benefit, and the effect ends for them.

#### Restitution
Starting at 6th level, whenever a creature benefitting from your Channel Divinity: Penance ability suffers damage; you may deflect a fraction of the damage back to the aggressor as a
reaction if it is within 60 ft. If multiple targets are damaged at the same time (such as by suffering
from an area of effect ability or spell), you can deflect the damage to the source, so long as it is
within 60 ft.

In both cases, this requires a successful ranged spell attack, and on a success, the creature damaging
the warded targets take damage equal to half all the damage they dealt. This does not alter the type
of damage dealt.

Furthermore, if you use Channel Divinity: Penance a creature that is already a target of your
Channel Divinity: Atonement, roll a d4. On a roll of 2 to 4, the Channel Divinity is not spent, and
can be used again.

#### Chakra Cleansing
Starting at 8th level, whenever you cast a shielding spell, you may apply one of
the two effects as a bonus action.
* You may dispel a magical effect the target suffers from. This acts as dispel magic with a spell
level equal to the level of the shielding spell you cast.
* You may grant additional temporary hit points equal to double the spell‘s level.

#### Infused Shield
Starting at 17th level, whenever you cast a healing or shielding spell, you may freely
convert temporary hit points from your priest spells to actual hit points, or vice versa. A healing
spell that grants temporary hit points is counted as a shielding spell, and benefits from the Chakra
Cleansing and Extended Wards abilities.
___
Furthermore, you may use your Channel Divinity: Penance ability as a reaction instead of an
action.

### Holy Light Priesthood
You are a vessel of the Holy Light‘s will, a versatile healer who can reverse damage on individuals or
groups and even heal from beyond the grave. Holy priests are well-adored and respected among the
Alliance.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Holy Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Bless, holy light |
| 3rd | Lesser restoration, spiritual weapon |
| 5th | Haste (or light‘s speed), revivify |
| 7th | Death ward, guardian of faith |
| 9th | Mass cure wounds (or hope of healing), mass revivify |

</div>

#### Light’s Insight
Starting at 1st level, whenever you cast a healing spell from the priest spell list and
the dice shows the maximum possible result (such as a 6 on a d6), you may roll the maximized dice
again and add the amount healed to the total. This applies to healing spells that deal damage to
undead. This acts similarly to the Holy Vision ability of the holy oath. If having both features, and
if the re-rolled dice results in a maximum result as well, you may roll a third time.

#### Light’s Embrace
Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use
a priest spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional
hit points equal to 2 + the spell‘s level. If the spell heals multiple creatures, the additional healing is
added to the total, not to each creature.

You may also turn fiends when you use your Channel Divinity to turn undead.

#### Channel Divinity: Restore Life
Starting at 2nd level, you may use your action while presenting
your holy symbol to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times
your priest level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can‘t
use this feature on a construct, but may target undead to damage by expending healing, dealing
holy damage instead of healing them.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
Also starting at 2nd level, you can, as an action, present your
holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you
within 30 feet of you must make a Spirit saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's
nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

When you reach 5th level, you can also outright destroy undead you turn with this feature.

When an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly
destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Turn Undead
table.

##### Turn Undead Table

| Priest Level | Destroys Undead of CR |
|:---:|:---:|
| 5th | 1/2 or lower
| 8th | 1 or lower
| 11th | 2 or lower
| 14th | 3 or lower
| 17th | 4 or lower

#### Channel Divinity: Focused Light
Starting at 6th level, you may use a channel divinity to alter the
target and refresh the duration of any healing sigil spell you cast on a target. This may be used
outside your turn, possibly recovering from a dispelled sigil by shifting it to another target. This
requires a spell attack as normal. This costs a reaction if used outside your turn, and a bonus action
if on your turn.

#### Angelic Form
Starting at 8th level, you gain the avatar form priest spell for no cost if you didn‘t
already have it. Furthermore, you augment the spell in the following ways:
* You can cast the spell as a reaction when reduced to 0 hit points. When this happens, the
spell also restores one-quarter your full hit points and mana. If you enter the avatar form
this way cast healing, restorative, and domain spells so long as the form persists.
* When you cast the spell, you can dispel one magical effect on you (as if by the dispel magic
spell, spell level equal to the avatar form spell).
___
After the spell‘s duration ends, you return to your normal form, and are reduced to 10% of your
maximum hit points. You also learn celestial, if you don‘t already know how to speak it.

#### Guardian Spirit
Starting at 17th level, you may target any ally within 30 ft., granting them a
guardian angel spirit. This spirit increases the amount of healing taken from all your priest spells by
25%, and may be sacrificed to either grant resistance against any one attack the target, or
automatically stabilize the target if they are reduced to 0 hit points. This does not affect constructs
or undead. This may be used once per rest.

### Moon Priesthood
You are part of the ancient and well-respected sisterhood of the night-elven moon goddess Elune,
and your path is of serenity, grace, and reflection. Moon priestesses favor using subtlety, the
bow, and hit-and-run techniques to guard her flock, but act in accordance with the two faces of the
moon.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Moon Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Shot array (all except black arrow), trueshot aura |
| 3rd | Invisibility, moonbeam |
| 5th | Remove curse, shooting star |
| 7th | Dominate, hallucinatory terrain |
| 9th | Dream, starfall |

</div>

#### Facets of the Moon Goddess
Upon choosing this priesthood, you become attuned to the dual
faces of Elune, the goddess of the moon. Whenever the moon (or one moon of your realm) enters a
new phase, you may adapt that aspect of Elune. This choice is made at the end of a long rest. This
changes how some of your priesthood features act.
* *Full Moon Aspect.* The full moon aspect of Elune is known as the Mother Moon. It is more
adept with healing and providing support, as well as ranged combat, and represents calm
wisdom and righteous, precise action.
* *New Moon.* The new moon aspect of Elune is known as the Night Warrior. It is more adept
with melee combat, and represents the furious savagery of nature, vengeful aspects of the
goddess, and her shepherding the souls of the dead to beyond the stars.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:400px;"></div>

You are also always able to see the moon (or its outline, if it if you have line of sight to it, even in
daylight. In the new moon phase, you can see the moon‘s outline. You cannot gain normally
benefits from observing it except at night, however, when Elune‘s power waxes, unless the power
specifies so.

#### Might of the Moon
Starting at 1st level, so long as you can observe the moon and are at night, you
are affected by the inner fire spell (level equal to highest spell level you can access). In other
conditions, the bonus provided by the spell is halved (minimum 0).

You do not require have to be outdoors to benefit from this feature. If there are multiple moons in
the realm you are in, any moon suffices.

#### Favor of Elune
Also starting at 1st level, you gain the Favored by Elune talent, and gain
proficiency with all ranged projectile weapons and medium armor. You also gain a one of the
following blessings, depending on the lunar phase you have chosen.
<br>
*Full Moon Priestess* You may add your spirit modifier to damage rolls with bows of all types.
<br>
*New Moon Priestess* You may choose one fighting style (chosen from the list of the warrior class).

#### Channel Divinity: Moonlight Calm
Starting at 2nd level, when you channel divinity, you may
channel an aspect of Elune‘s grace to calm a creature within 30 feet of you. You may target a
humanoid or beast, or a creature in another shape (such as a druid in wild shape or a shapeshifter).
* If you target a beast or humanoid, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or it
is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is
friendly to you and other creatures you designate. If you treat them fairly, they do not revert to
their original hostility after the duration ends.

* If you target a Druid in their Wild Shape or a shapeshifting creature, they revert to their
original shape if they fail a Charisma saving throw, and cannot shapeshift for one minute. They
may repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn every round.

#### Channel Divinity: Moonlight Ward
Starting at 6th level, you may spend a Channel Divinity use
as a bonus action and designate one ally within 30 feet as your moonlight ward. The ward remains
for 1 minute. Depending on the phase of the moon, your ward has one of the following effects:
* *Full Moon*. So long as the ally remains within range, you may use a bonus action to heal the
target with any healing spell from the priest spell list that normally requires an action. If the
spell normally costs a bonus action to cast (such as the flash of light spell), it may instead cast it
as a reaction.
* *New Moon*. So long as the ally within range, you can cast any spell that deals psychic or shadow
damage as a bonus action so long as you target a creature who attacked your moonlit ward in
the last round. If the spell normally costs a bonus action to cast (such as the flash of light spell),
it may instead cost a reaction. You cannot cast sigil spells this way.
___
If you successfully dealt weapon damage to an enemy before using the moonlight ward, the mana
cost of the spell (healing or damaging, respectively) is reduced by 1 (minimum 1). This can stack
with the normal reduction for repeat-casting a spell.

#### Elune’s Grace
Starting at 8th level, you can bless creatures with a shard of your goddess‘s grace.
Depending on your chosen phase, you can grant a creature you affect by your spells one of the
below blessings. Once you use the blessings three times, you cannot bless another creature until you
complete a short rest. You may use multiple blessings per round (they do not require an action).
* *Full Moon*. You priest spells that restore hit points heal the maximum amount for the dice for
one target.
* *New Moon*. Your priest spells that deal psychic or shadow damage deal maximum damage for
the dice for one target.
___
If you are under the effects of the avatar form priest spell, you can use the blessing two additional
times before a short rest.

#### Moon's Luck
Starting at 17th level, you gain the Lucky feat. You have a number of Luck Points
equal to half of your Priest level (rounded down) in the following conditions, depending on the
phase you have chosen:
* *Full Moon*. When you are under direct moonlight.
* *New Moon*. When you are under the new moon.
___
You may use Luck Points to use your Elune‘s Grace feature instead of the number of limited
blessings. In other conditions to the ones specified, each Luck Point has half the benefit (requiring
spending two points instead of one for a benefit of the feat).

### Shadow Priesthood
You answered the call of the Old Gods, joining the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow, gaining powers
over the eldritch mysteries and powers of the ancient changed beings. Shadow Priests use sinister
shadow magic, especially sigil spells, to eradicate enemies.
<br><br>
<div class='classTable'>

#### Shadow Priesthood Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Dissonant whispers, sleep |
| 3rd | Fear, hex array (only dream eat) |
| 5th | Blight, curse of weakness |
| 7th | Black tentacles (or old gods‘ grasp), confusion |
| 9th | Hold (up to 4 creature types), vampiric aura |

</div>

#### Shadow Orbs
Starting at 1st level, whenever you successfully deal psychic damage to an enemy
through a spell or ability, you gain one Shadow orb. This applies once per spell. Shadow orbs
spheres may be used to empower your abilities. Shadow Orbs may be spent for the following.
* Meld into Madness. Reduce the mana cost of one priest spell you cast. The reduction in
mana cost is one point per Shadow orb removed (minimum mana cost 1). For each level of
madness you have, a single Shadow orb can reduce the mana cost by 0.5 points (round
down).
* Prey on the Psyche. Deal 1 additional point of psychic damage per damage dice with spells
and abilities that deal psychic damage. This can be spent after rolling for damage, and
applies once per spell. This does not stack with similar abilities.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:420px;"></div>

___
You may have a maximum number of orbs equal to 2 plus your Proficiency bonus, and they remain
for one hour after being acquired.

#### Mind Quickening
Also starting at 1st level, your expanded mind gives you the ability to touch the
minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within
30 feet of you. You don‘t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your
telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

You may also pronounce the verbal components of your priest spells mentally, so that only the
target can hear them. This way, you cast spells in areas of silence or while muted, so long as at least
one target of the spell is within 30 feet and within line of sight.

#### Attuned to the Void
Starting at 2nd level, you may dip your spells into the raw maddening power
of the Void, coloring them permanently. Choose a number of priest spells equal to your proficiency
bonus.

You may scribe such spells that deal damage with other energy types as psychic or shadow spells in
your spellbook. The spells act the same way, unless the DM rules it is unreasonable.

#### Channel Divinity: Devouring Plague
Also starting at 2nd level, you may use an action while
presenting your unholy symbol to evoke dark energy, dealing psychic damage equal to five times
your priest level, halved with a Spirit saving throw. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and
divide the damage among them. This feature can reduce a creature to no more than half of its hit
point maximum. You can‘t use this feature on undead or constructs. You regain hit points equal to

If you have at least one shadow orb before using this ability, you may choose to gain no shadow
orbs from this ability‘s use for the round, and share the healing gained with them (costing one
shadow orb to include one creature in the sharing).

You may reduce the amount of hit points you (and your chosen allies) can potentially gain from
this ability and convert the healing energies to mana restoration. Every five hit points of healing are
converted to one mana point (up to a maximum of half the healing potential). Once a creature
benefits from this mana restoration, it cannot benefit again until it completes a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Focused Psyche
Starting at 6th level, you may use a channel divinity to alter the
target and refresh the duration of any damaging sigil spell you cast on a target. This may be used
outside your turn, possibly recovering from a dispelled sigil by shifting it to another target. This
requires a spell attack as normal. This costs a reaction if used outside your turn, and a bonus action
if on your turn.

#### Shadow Form
Starting at 8th level, you gain the avatar form priest spell for no cost if you didn‘t
already have it. Furthermore, you augment the spell in the following ways:
* You can cast the spell as a reaction when reduced to 0 hit points. When this happens, the
spell also restores one-quarter your full hit points and mana, and grants you 4 Shadow
orbs. If you enter the avatar form this way, you can only cast psychic, sigil, and domain
spells so long as the form persists.
* When you cast the spell, you can dispel one magical effect on you (as if by the dispel magic
spell, spell level equal to the avatar form spell).
___
After the spell‘s duration ends, you return to your normal form, and are reduced to 10% of your
maximum hit points. You also learn shath‘yar, if you don‘t already know how to speak it.

#### Vampiric Embrace
Starting at 17th level, whenever you deal damage with a damaging sigil or
psychic effect, you may can count one-quarter the damage dealt and grant it as healing to allies
within 30 feet of the target, dividing the healing evenly. You may instead divide the damage by ten,
and grant it as mana restoration to the same number of targets.

Unlike normal mana restoration effects, this can benefit a target up to three times before it cannot
be used again for an hour, although you cannot restore more mana to yourself than the cost of the
spell you used.

## Rogue (RGE)

*A hooded figure walks towards the entrance of a shop,
as a crow as black as night flies from its rest above the
shop‘s sign. The human shopkeeper studies the man
carefully, before sliding a book from its shelf. The
bookcase slowly creaks open and the hooded figure
enters the dark passage. As the figure passes, they toss
a single silver piece with an odd symbol to the counter
top, which is quickly collected by the shopkeep.*
<br><br>
*Lost, a traveler finds a mansion in the middle of the
woods. Starving and cold, she approaches the manor.
Inside the guests lay motionless, slumped over their
dinner. She slowly walks up to the head of the table, where she sees the heavy frame of a man. She
notices a wide cut in his neck, as a sharp pain is felt in her chest. As the traveler looks down, a
black dagger protrudes from her abdomen. Falling to the ground she sees the rotten grin of a
forsaken, as blood spills to the ground and she draws her last breath.*
<br><br>
*In a run-down inn on the coast, a band of sailors drink and sing merrily into the night. Suddenly a
goblin, clad in leather and armed with a shortsword and loaded pistol, strolls in. All faces turn to
the wanted sign across the room mirroring the goblin intruder‘s face. With a grin the goblin cocks
her pistol, and in a few moments, the goblin leaves the inn once more, swinging a few purses
stained with blood.*

### Skill and Precision
Rogues possess a wide range of skills that allow them to accomplish feats from finding secret doors
to smacking a magic item until it works. They are excellent in a fight, and if they can strike quickly
or unseen — or are flanking an enemy with the help of a thoughtful ally — they can be truly deadly.
Of course, they also excel at stealth.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

The rogues of Azeroth are the masters of subterfuge, skilled and cunning adversaries of those who
dare not look into the shadows to see what lurks there. Roguery is a profession for those who seek
the adventures of stalking in silent forests, dimly lit halls, and heavily guarded strongholds. Using
trickery in combat and able to vanish at the slightest distraction, the rogue is a welcome addition to
any group of adventurers. Ideal spies, deadly to those they can catch unaware, rogues have no
problem finding a place in the world. Deadly masters of stealth, rogues are the whispers in shadowy
corners and the hooded figures crossing dark fields. Skilled with daggers and the art of silent death,
these vagabonds and bandits skulk about Azeroth seeking targets and profit. A member of almost
any race can learn the tricks necessary to become a skilled rogue. Still, for the tauren and draenei,
such a profession is an alien concept and therefore rare among those peoples. Whether they are
diplomats, spies, thieves, scoundrels, entertainers, or simply adventurers, they can be found plying
just about any trade from Mount Hyjal to Ratchet.

### A Shady Living
Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They‘re the shadows
in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike—then they dispatch an
opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are
opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there‘s an unparalleled art to what they do.

From the high-contract assassin hired in secret by respected noblemen to the lowly street mugger,
rogues are the ones called upon when maintaining the status quo requires a questionable solution
— and by fulfilling it, they are branded as outcasts by the very society that calls upon their service.

\pagebreakNum

In Azeroth, rogues are largely free agents, though some prefer to join an organization for safety and
ease of employment. Ravenholdt and the Syndicate are examples. Other recognized rogue
organizations include the Shattered Hand, the Deathstalkers, and SI:7.

### Creating a Rogue
As you create your rogue character, consider the character‘s relationship to the law. Do you have a
criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves‘ guild master?
Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you
in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?

What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone
terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery
gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life.

Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself out off
from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you
made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities
for earning a living and employing your particular talents.

Rogues represent thieves, treasure-hunters, cunning spies, and aspiring adventurers. Using their
skills and cunning (and sometimes gifted with a knack for technology or strange magics), rogues are
always welcome to any faction, and many works for more than two at any given time as scouts,
double agents, and false merchants.

For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the
constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins
and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and
vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground.

#### Quick Build
You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First. Agility should be your highest
ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation. Choose
Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the
charlatan background.

\pagebreakNum

#### Expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your
proficiency with thieves‘ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make
that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves‘ tools) to gain
this benefit.

#### Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe‘s distraction. Once per turn,
you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on
the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don‘t need advantage on the
attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn‘t incapacitated, and
you don‘t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak
Attack column of the Rogue table.

#### Thieves’ Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves‘ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that
allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows
thieves‘ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it
does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols
used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a
thieves‘ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will
provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

#### Rogue Talent
Starting at 2nd level, you gain a class talent, representing your ability to function under pressure or
perform specialized tasks, either by quick thinking, good use of skill, special aptitude towards
magic, or by lightning-fast reflexes. See Class Talents at the end of the Chapter 3 for options.

Whenever you qualify for another talent (as detailed in the talent column), you can choose another
talent or gain another use of an existing talent.

#### Roguish Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities:
Assassination, which focuses on capturing the opponent unawares a quickly dispatching of them,
Outlaw, which focuses on dueling and swashbuckling, and Subtlety, which attunes one‘s self with
shadows so much that they begin to aid him. All are detailed at the end of the class description.
Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one
ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
normal, you can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or
invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

#### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a
target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you
can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can‘t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/j0RJ7pI.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; left:-40px; width:100%; height:100%;' />

### Assassination
You are deadly master of poisons, who can dispatch various victims with vicious dagger strikes and
amazing talents. Assassins are usually independent agents who perform contracts with various
organizations to further their own goals.

#### Assassinate
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies.

You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn‘t taken a turn in the combat yet.

In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

Also, if you don‘t already have proficiency with a poisoner‘s kit, you gain proficiency in it, and you
gain advantage to saving throws against your own poisons.

#### Disrupting Strike [Strike]
Also starting at 3rd level, you gain experience in fighting casters.

Whenever you deal sneak attack damage with a melee weapon, you may give up a portion of the
damage to inflict on the target the distracted condition for one round per 1d6 of sneak attack given
up.

#### Dispatch
Starting at 9th level, whenever attacking a target that is bloodied, your sneak attack dice
improves from 1d6 to d10.

#### Expert Poisoner
Starting at 13th level, the Poisoned condition if delivered by you also inflicts
disadvantage on one saving throw type you choose for the duration of the condition. You also
gather triple the normal amount of crafting materials for poisons when harvesting (such as from
raw materials or from creatures).

#### Vendetta
Starting at 17th level, you may mark one target within 100 feet with an action, and have
advantage to all Perception checks to perceive them, as well as advantage to the first attack of every
turn against them. The benefits remain for one minute, and may be used once before a short rest.

.

\columnbreak

### Outlaw
You are a swashbuckler, duelists, or combatant who uses agility and guile to stand toe-to-toe with
opponents. Outlaw rogues are usually pirates and highwaymen.

#### Riposte
Starting at 3rd level, you may deflect an incoming attack by using a reaction, thereby
adding your Proficiency bonus to your AC. If your AC is then high enough to make the enemy
miss after it would have been a success, you can make an attack of opportunity against the enemy.

Outlaw rogues also gain proficiency with firearms and explosives.

#### Revealing Strike [Strike]
Also at 3rd level, a target struck with this ability must make an Agility
saving throw contested by your own. If you succeed, the target loses all increases to AC from a
single type against all targets for until the end of your next round. This may be used to nullify
armor bonuses, insight bonuses, or Agility bonuses, but not all three.

A creature that suffers the effects of Revealing Strike cannot be targeted again for 24 hours. This is
a strike effect that costs a bonus action.

#### Quick Combatant
Beginning at 9th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.

If you roll a successful attack roll with one of these attacks, you may forgo dealing damage with that
attack to give yourself advantage on the next attack you make. This may only be done with melee
attacks.

#### Disabling Strike [Strike]
Starting at 13th level, your keen eye and calculating mind makes your
Sneak Attacks even more potent. Whenever you succeed on an attack that deals Sneak Attack
damage, you may elect to not deal sneak attack damage, and force your target to make an Agility
saving throw contested by your own. If the target fails the saving throw, it gains one of the following
conditions at your choice.
* Slowed by 1/2 their normal movement rate for until the end of its turn in the next round.
* Blinded for until the end of its turn in the next round.
* Stunned for until the end of its turn in the next round.
___
This is a strike effect that costs a bonus action. A creature cannot suffer more than once against
your Disabling Strike in 24 hours. If you have the dire strike ability, you can deal half your sneak
attack damage when applying a dire strike.

#### Killing Spree
Starting at 17th level, you tap into your reserves of speed, going into a killing spree.

While you are in this state, you may double your movement and gain advantage on your first attack
at the beginning of every round. Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. This state
remains for 1 minute, or until you spend one of your rounds without making an attack roll or if
you are not targeted with an attack roll. This may be used once per short rest.

\pagebreakNum

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/j0RJ7pI.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; left:-40px; width:100%; height:100%;' />

### Subtlety
Your affinity with shadows reached beyond the mundane, tapping into shadowy arcane powers.
Subtlety rogues are often spies who sell their secrets to the highest bidder.

#### Shadow Spellcasting
Drawing on mysterious shadow-magics, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. You
cast spells drawn from the Mage spell list, and are restricted to spells from the Conjuration,
Evocation, Enchantment, and Illusion schools. You may also scribe spells in Thieves‘ Cant. You
also gain a spellbook as a 1st-level mage.

You gain bonus spells on your 8th, 14th, and 20th level. These spells can be of any schools.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.
One of your cantrips must be the mage hand cantrip.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each rogue level provides you with 0.5 a caster level in the Mage class (minimum 0). You follow the
normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of Mage spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the mage spell
list. Your spellcasting otherwise follows the same rules as the mage class (with regards to which
creatures you can conjure, spellbooks, etc.). Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence.

#### Premeditation
Also on 3rd level, you may use 3 rounds (counted as 3 actions) to study an enemy.

If you do, you may always apply your sneak attack damage against them (even without advantage or
an ally nearby) for one minute, unless the target moves more than their full speed in one round. In
addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

#### Vanish
Starting at 9th level, you may grant yourself invisibility as a reaction. This invisibility
remains until the end of your next turn. This may be used once per point of Intelligence modifier,
and replenishes after a short rest.

#### Shadow Dance
Starting at 13th level, you may initiate a shadow dance by moving more than 10
feet. While in this stance, you grant yourself concealment as per the blur spell. Also while in the
stance, creatures affected or distracted by your mage spells (such as a summoned monster or an
image illusion, but not the distracted condition) grant you advantage to your first attack at any
round. This may be used once per short rest, and remains so long as you continue moving.

#### Backstab
Starting at 17th level, when you target a bloodied creature with a sneak attack, you may
deal double the sneak attack damage. Once affected, the target is immune to this ability until they
complete a short rest.

## Shaman (SHM)
*A tauren standing atop a cliff calmly raises his hand,
leaning on a giant halberd, sprinkling reagents upon
the grasslands below. The golden dust is carried on a
spirit of the wind. A giant totem bound to his back
trembles in approval.*
<br><br>
*A red-bearded dwarf stands on shaking ground,
unmoved, as the earth cracks before him, spewing the
beginnings of lava. As his comrades collapse, he
points at it with commanding presence, shouting in a
primordial tongue that speaks to the very earth. The
beginnings of a chaotic volcanic eruption slow, before
the primal powers of the earth and fire retreat,
calmed, back into the earth.*
<br><br>
*Cleaving through fiendish foes with a bloodied axe in one hand and lightning-enhanced attack
claws in the other, the orc shouts a war cry to rally his allies. Bearing a wolf-pelt over his shoulders,
he raises an olive-skinned arm to the skies, summoning a bolt of lightning from the stormy clouds
before, which he then sends at a gathering of demons with a resounding clap of thunder.*
<br><br>
Shaman are mortal mediators between the very elements themselves. Often spiritual guides of their
communities, these powerful practitioners commune with the ancestors and seek to balance the
raging elemental forces, and can call upon them in battle to scorch and blast their enemies, or to
strengthen and heal their allies. Shaman can enhance their weapons with elemental effects, smite
enemies with lightning strikes and bursts of lava, and summon powerful elementals to their aid.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:520px;"></div>

### Spiritual Powers
Shaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike
some other mystics, shaman commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements
are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It
is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire,
water, and air, shaman summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman‘s allies or
punish those who threaten them.

Shaman are spiritual visionaries of tribes and clans. These gifted warriors can see into the world of
spirits and communicate with creatures invisible to the eyes of normal beings. They are beset by
visions of the future and use their sight to guide their people through troubled times. Although
shaman may seem wise and serene at first, they are formidable foes; when angered, their wrath is as
fierce as those who have a connection to divines or to nature.

During combat, shaman place damaging and controlling totems on the ground to maximize their
effectiveness while hindering their enemies. Shaman are versatile enough to battle foes up close or
at range, but wise shamans choose their avenue of attack based on their enemies' strengths and
weaknesses.

### Gift of the Elements
Commanding chaotic and conflicting elements, a shaman is a force that hears the world tremble
and directs its wrath. Communicating with spirits of flame, winds, and stone, shamans channel the

\pagebreakNum

power of the storm, earth, and fire to their will. A shaman‘s holy symbol is a small ancestral relic or
totem of bone, wood, or iron that can be carried in one‘s hand.

The elements are chaotic, however, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in
unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos, acting as
moderators among earth, fire, water, and air. The spirit of life is a hidden and elusive one, but
shamans often channel healing energies through water until they are able and proficient enough to
negotiate bringing the dead to life via invoking life spirits.

As shamans mediate between elemental spirits, it is unsurprising that such aptitude eventually
translates to connecting with other kinds of spirits as well, including that of incorporeal undead
(such as banshees or ghosts) or the shaman‘s own ancestors.

Besides the great shamanistic traditions of the orcs, Wildhammer dwarves are familiar with
shamanism in its ancestral worship form, and Tauren are most well-versed with the spirits of earth
and sky, both having traditions ancient to modern Azeroth.

### Creating a Shaman
When you create your shaman the most important question to ask is how you became attuned to
the spirits. Was it a natural event such as being born during a mystical meteor shower? Did terrible
dreams plague you as a child and it wasn‘t until you had matured that you realized the truth of your
abilities?

How does your character perceive their abilities? Maybe you view them as a duty to the souls
around you, an endless task to lend aid to the spirits and help them into the afterlife? Or even
perhaps you view the spirits as tools to advance your own plans, choosing to exploit the spirits you
see rather than helping them?

#### Quick Build
You can make a shaman quickly by following these suggestions. First, Spirit should be your highest
ability score, followed by Strength or Stamina. Second, choose the hermit background. Third,
choose the create bonfire, invoke elements, and thunderclap cantrips, along with the following 1st-level

</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Kalimag
You know Kalimag, the language of elementals and wind, earth, fire, and water spirits. You can
speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language
automatically spot such a message. If you can speak Kalimag, you can communicate with all other
shamans and elementals, even if you don‘t otherwise share a language.

#### Spellcasting
By 1st level, you have learned to draw on raw elemental might through meditation and
communication with the elements.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.

##### Conjuring and Binding
A shaman can conjure and bind aberrations, elementals, fiends, oozes, and undead, as well spirit
creatures (creatures with the spirit template).

Furthermore, you can be Called (see Calling, see Chapter 10) by the elements and elementals,
although they usually only call to ask for aid regarding circumstances that threaten the balance of
powers, such as extensive drilling efforts, an upcoming wildfire in a dry area, or a coming storm in
around 24 hours before they take place.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
Each shaman level provides you with 1 caster level in the shaman class. You follow the normal
progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section).

You prepare the list of shaman spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the shaman
spell list.

You can also change your list of prepared spells by consulting your totem (treat as a spellbook) after
a long rest. Preparing a new list of shaman spells requires time spent in study: at least 1 minute per
spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Spirit is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, since you learn your shaman spells through
primal contact with the elemental forces.

You use your Spirit whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Spirit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
<br><br>
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +

your Spirit modifier

##### Spellbook – Master Totem
At 1st level, your totem contains six 1st-level shaman spells of your choice. When you level up, you
gain 2 additional shaman spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by research,
tutelage, or from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have spells you can cast.

Your totem is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by meditating with it and burning
incense and rare herbs. This totem is usually also known as your spell totem.

\columnbreak

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your shamanistic symbol as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells. These are
typically totems, tufts of wolf hair, or a carving of your spiritual animal.

#### Shamanistic Art
Choose one shamanistic art or focus related to how you view the elements and how they have
received you, such as Elemental to focus on bringing the elements‘ wrath down, enhancement to
strengthen yourself through the elements, or restoration, in which the elements are in balance.
Each art is detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you art spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants
you additional ways to use Channel Elements when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and
additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

#### Art Spells
Each art has a list of spells—its art spells—that you gain at the shaman levels noted in the art
description. Once you gain an art spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn‘t count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have an art spell that doesn‘t appear on the
priest spell list, the spell is nonetheless a shaman spell for you.

#### Channel Elements
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel elemental energy directly, using that energy to fuel
magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Elementals and an effect determined by your
art. Some arts grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the art description.

When you use your Channel Elements, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a
short or long rest to use your Channel Elements again.

Some Channel Elements effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class,
the DC equals your shaman spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
Elements twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests.
When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

##### Channel Elements: Turn Elementals
As an action, you present your shamanistic symbol and speak a prayer dismissing and quelling
elementals. Each elemental that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Spirit saving
throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can‘t
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can‘t take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there‘s
nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

While it is turned, you may also opt to calm the elemental, rendering it passive and not hostile for
one minute. If treated fairly and listened to, the elemental might reveal why it is angered, and may
demand from the shaman to address a problem that is wracking the elementals in the region (or
beyond).

\pagebreakNum

#### Mana Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you may rapidly recover your mana by calling out to fonts of spiritual power.
You can use your action and bonus action on your turn to regain mana as if completed a short rest
(or rested for one hour).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. You regain
expended uses when you finish a long rest. While using this feature, the flow of elemental power
protects you, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made against you, and granting you advantage
to saving throws until the start of your turn in the next round.

Alternatively, if you use this during a short rest or when you are below one-quarter your maximum
mana point pool, you are treated as if you rested for two hours instead of one. This is atop the
mana you regain for the normal rest.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can‘t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Release Elemental
Starting at 5th level, when an elemental fails its saving throw against your Turn Elemental feature,
you may subject the creature to a dispel (as the dispel magic spell), release it from its bindings (if
bound by the bind or essence seal spells), return it to its realm of origin (as the banishment spell), or
destroy it outright if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Release
Elemental table. This ability only functions when you declare your intention to use it.
 
| Shaman Level  | Releases Elemental of CR |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| 5th | 1/2 or lower
| 8th | 1 or lower
| 11th | 2 or lower
| 14th | 3 or lower
| 17th | 4 or lower

If targeting an elemental whose essence is captured and is being used to fuel a device with an
elemental engine, you can cause it to suffer from the malfunctioned condition with a successful
spell attack against the wielder of the device. If the device already is malfunctioned, a successful
spell attack releases the elemental instead, which appears at any point between you and the device
(you can choose the point). Such elementals usually serve the shaman for 1 day or until they can
return the favor.

Destroying elementals is a secret art known to shamans, and is typically only used against
elementals that are corrupted by fel energies, as elementals are usually receptive to shamans who
turn them (see above).

#### Elemental Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on the elements of Azeroth to intervene on your behalf when
your need is great. Imploring the elements‘ aid requires you to use your action. Describe the
assistance you seek, and roll a percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your
shaman level, the elements intervene. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of
any shaman spell or art spell would be appropriate. This ability is treated as divine intervention in
all respects.

If the elements intervene, you can‘t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again
after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll
required.

### Elemental
Your ability to command the elements at long ranges, and influence and aid their allies at equal
distance is renowned and respected. Elementalists make up most adventuring shamans.
<br><br>
<div class="classTable">

#### Elemental Art Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Fog cloud, elemental shock |
| 3rd | Animal messenger (or animal spirit), gust of wind |
| 5th | Call lightning, sending |
| 7th | Control water, ice storm |
| 9th | Maelstrom, teleport circle (to areas of elemental power) |

</div>

#### Elemental Mastery
Starting at 1st level, you may change any elemental damage type dealt by your
shaman spells to another type. This requires a bonus action.

#### Acclimation
Also at 1st level, you are also immune to the hostile effects of weather. By spending
an action, you can determine the weather for the next 24 hours with a 50% degree of accuracy. You
can also sense any weather-changing spells when they are being cast within 5 miles of your location,
and can roughly identify whether the caster is a friend or foe to the elements or shamans.

Channel Elements: Wrath. At 2nd level, you can spend a Channel Elements use to wield the
power of the elements with unchecked ferocity. When you roll for any type of elemental damage,
you can use a Channel Elements attempt to deal maximum damage instead.

#### Elemental Mixing
Starting at 6th level, when you roll elemental damage from a shaman spell of
spell level 1 1st or higher, you can apply one of the following effects.
* *Earth Slide*. The target is pushed 10 feet in any direction you choose.
* *Fire Sear*. The target is scorched for one round.
* *Frost Snap*. The target is chilled for one round.
* *Storm Toss*. The target takes disadvantage to attack rolls.
___
These effects stack with others, whenever possible (such as by the elemental shock spell). For example,
an elemental shock that deals lightning (lightning shock) normally imposes the Storm Toss effect. You
can also add the Earth Slide effect to push the target as well.

#### Bonded Elemental
Starting at 8th level, you may conjure an elemental and render its duration
permanent. If the elemental dies, you can perform the ritual again to summon another. This
elemental does not require concentration to maintain and does not count against the normal limit
for the bind spell, with a maximum spell level rendered permanent equal to one-half the maximum
spell level of the elemental you can bond.

#### Elemental Storm
When you reach level 17, you gain the ability to summon a fully-realized
thunderstorm, snowstorm, or firestorm at your location. The earth is blanketed by a 5-mile radius
centered on you for one hour. This otherwise acts as control weather, and takes 10 minutes to cast
as normal. However, so long as the elemental storm is active, you may also use an action to cause a
10-foot wide cylinder of elemental wrath that deals 10d6 damage (thunder, lighting, cold, or fire,
depending on the storm type). The range of this ability is as far as you can see within the radius,
and the affected creatures are entitled an Agility saving throw to half damage.

Whenever you call the elemental cylinder, the dice damage is reduced by 2d6. When they reach
0d6, the storm ends prematurely (even if maintaining concentration), as the elemental spirits
become calmer. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until after a long rest.

### Enhancement
Your magic is woven to your combat style, empowering your ability harm their enemies in melee
combat. Enhancement shamans usually use two weapons.
<br><br>
<div class="classTable">

#### Enhancement Art Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Elemental tongue, shield
| 3rd | Conjure (Spirit Dire Wolf), earth shield
| 5th | Bloodlust, spirit infusion
| 7th | Death ward, freedom of movement (or grace of air)
| 9th | Windfury tongue, true seeing

</div>

#### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. Also, you gain the
Dual Wielder feat if you didn‘t already have it. If you already have it, you add +1 to your weapon
damage rolls with either weapon.

#### Elemental Command
Also at 1st level, you gain increased proficiency and command over the
elements. You may perform any of the following abilities a number of times equal to your Spirit
modifier. All such uses of elemental command are restored after a short rest.

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:500px;"></div>

* *Command the Storm*. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an
attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make an Agility saving throw. The
creature takes 2d6 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half
as much damage on a successful one. If they took at least 5 points of damage, they are pushed 5
feet away. The damage increases by 1 dice for every two spell levels you can access above 1st
level (up to 6d6).
* *Command the Earth*. You may send a tremor through the earth as a bonus action as an elemental
command, unbalancing your enemies. In a 30-foot-sphere centered on you, you may send a
shockwave, dealing 2d6 + your Spirit modifier in bludgeoning damage (or your off-handed
weapon damage, whichever is higher), with an Agility saving throw to half damage. You may
instead shape this as a 15-foot-long cone, or a 30-foot-long line. If you also have the Tremor
talent, you may expend a use of Tremor. If you elect to do so, creatures who fail the Agility
saving throw are also knocked prone and suffer 5 additional points of damage. The damage
increases by 1 dice for every two spell levels you can access above 1st level (up to 6d6).
* *Command the Flame*. You may cast fire bolt as a bonus action or as a reaction as a use of
elemental command. You may add this damage to your off-hand attack as part of the same
action.
___
Also, choose one weapon you are proficient in and enhance it with a shard of your essence. So long
as you wield the weapon, it counts as a spellcasting focus, and you may use it to perform somatic
components of your shaman spells. You can only have one weapon enhanced this way.

#### Channel Elements: Elementalist Combat
At 2nd level, you can spend a Channel Elements use to
invoke a blessing from the elementals. This does not cost an action. This blessing boosts your
combat capabilities beyond those even of experienced warriors for 1 minute. While this blessing is
active, your strike and shot effects do not cost a bonus action to apply, so long as they are from the
shaman class or from shaman spells. Furthermore, if you successfully affect the target with two
attacks or more, you may push the creature up to 10 feet away (plus an additional 10 feet for each
extra attack), so long as it is not more than one size category larger you. If the strike would normally
push the enemy, the forced movement does not stack.

The blessing ends early if you are knocked unconscious, or if their turn ends without being
attacked or attacking a hostile creature, or if not casting a non-cantrip shaman spell.
Flurry. Starting at 6th level, when you take an action to attack, you can attack twice instead of
once.

#### Spirit Wolves
Starting at 8th level, you can summon two dire wolves with the spirit template as an
action, which take their turns immediately after yours. The wolves dissipate after 5 minutes, and do
not require concentration. So long as the wolves are within 10 feet of you, your movement speed
increases to match their own.

Furthermore, whenever you succeed on more than two attacks and the spirit wolves are within 30
feet of you, they can make an attack of opportunity as a reaction against any creature that is within
5 feet of them. If either succeeds on attacking, you regain 1d6+1 hit points.

After using this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. The DM has the
wolves‘ statistics, and applies the spirit template appropriately. The dire wolves‘ Challenge is always
of a value equal to one-eighth your shaman level (allowing you to enhance them, as described in the
Monster Guide).

#### Greater Investitures
Starting at 17th level, you can may cast one of the four ‘Investiture‘ spells
(Investiture of Flame, Investiture of Wind, etc.) with a use of Elemental Command.

While under the effects of one of the spells, whenever you cast the elemental shock or elemental tongue
spells that deals the same damage type as described in the investiture (if any), the spell deals double
damage (as if a critical hit). This can stack with a critical hit (up to triple damage).

## Restoration
You focuses on magic that heals and divines the future—your totems, as a consequence, are stronger
than that of other paths. Restoration shamans are often thought of as more spiritual than others,
and are known as witch-shamans or spirit-walkers.

#### Restoration Art Spells

<div style="margin-top:10px;"></div>

| Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Healing ward, riptide
| 3rd | Ancestral guardians, totemic recall
| 5th | Healing stream, revivify (or ancestral sight)
| 7th | Death ward, spirit link totem
| 9th | Healing stream totem, tranquility (or healing rain)

</div>

#### Ancestral Blessing
At 1st level, whenever you heal a creature, you add your Spirit modifier to the
total amount of healing given. This applies once per spell. If the target is blood-related to you or
sworn to the same blood-oath, the benefits of this ability is doubled for them. See Chapter 10 for
details on Blood Oaths.

Also, any healing totem costs 1 less mana point to cast (minimum 1).

\columnbreak

<div style="margin-top:470px;"></div>

#### Elusive Totems
Also starting at 1st level, you may move any or all of your totems up to half your
own speed as a reaction, not as a bonus action. This cannot interrupt an attack, but gives the totem
a bonus to AC equal to your Spirit modifier versus an attack you react to.

You also increase their hit points by your level (to a total of three times your level). Totems also
gain the benefit of the Evasion rogue ability when using your Agility saving throw bonus.

Lastly, if one of your totems are destroyed, you regain one-quarter the mana cost you spent on it.
If you are traveling overland with totems out, they move with you.

#### Channel Elements: Life-Link
Starting at 2nd level, you may channel the elements and spend an
action to cast effects spirit link spell (even if you normally cannot cast it). Furthermore, whenever a
creature is healed, the healing is also distributed through the link as well. You may add this effect
to as an existing spirit link spell as well by using channel divinity, so long as you were the one who
cast it.

#### Cleanse Spirit
Starting at 6th level, you may use an action to cast the dispel magic spell (spell level
equal to the highest spell level you can access) to any creature within 30 feet, but not on objects,
areas, or creatures without spirits (such as Undead or Constructs). This may be used a number of
times equal to your Spirit modifier (minimum 1). You may spend three uses to cast the remove
curse instead with the same limitations. All expended uses are replenished at a long rest. To
unwilling targets, this must be a ranged spell attack.

Also, whenever you dispel any number of magical effects, you may choose to apply one of the
following additional effects:

\pagebreakNum

* Allow the target to spend a hit dice to heal themselves
* Deal 1d6 points of arcane damage for each spell level removed
* Reduce the target‘s speed by 10 feet for 1 minute

#### Deep Healing
Starting at 8th level, your healing spells heal much more if the target is already
wounded. If the target of one of your shaman healing spells is bloodied, the benefits of your
Ancestral Blessing ability is doubled (double your Spirit modifier in extra hit points). If the target is
at 0 hit points and is unstable, the benefits triple.

Also, so long as one of your shaman totems is within 30 feet of you, you can cast any shaman
healing spell through it as if you were standing in its space. You can ‗chain‘ the shaman totem,
extending healing via the totems you prepare.

#### Totem Mastery
Starting at 17th level, you may activate two totems with the same reaction. You
may also include totems in the spirit link spell or effect, despite them being objects and not
creatures. For this purpose, they have resistance against any damage shared through the link,
soaking up the total damage distributed.

Also, whenever one of your totems is attacked (and not necessarily hit), it can move 10 feet in any
direction. If it ends adjacent to an ally, the totem regains 2d6 hit points.
